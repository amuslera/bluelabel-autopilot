### TASK-161H: Create Consolidated Roles & Responsibilities Document
Status: COMPLETED ✅
Assigned: CC
Priority: HIGH
Created: 2025-05-23

- ✅ Documented ARCH-AI role as Strategic Architect with orchestration authority
- ✅ Specified detailed responsibilities and constraints for each implementation agent (CC, CA, WA)
- ✅ Established inter-agent communication protocols and standards
- ✅ Created collaboration patterns and escalation procedures
- ✅ Included compliance requirements and quick reference matrix

**Key Components:**
- Human Tech Lead: Ultimate authority with override powers
