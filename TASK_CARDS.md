## TASK-161CP: Implement .env-Based Config Loader for Secure Credentials

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** 2025-05-27
**Assignee:** CC
**Branch:** `dev/TASK-161CP-cc-config-loader-env`

### Objective
Create a central configuration manager that loads secure runtime values from a `.env` file (or system environment), with optional fallback to static YAML or Python defaults.

### Implementation Details

**Core Implementation:**
1. **Config Loader Module:**
   - Created `/services/config/config_loader.py` (225 lines)
   - Implements `Config` class with environment variable priority
   - Supports `.env` file auto-loading from project root
   - Provides singleton pattern via `get_config()`

2. **Configuration Categories:**
   - Gmail OAuth settings (client ID, secret, user, paths)
   - SMTP configuration (server, port, credentials, TLS)
   - Email defaults (sender, recipient)
   - LLM API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
   - Environment settings (dev/prod, log level)
   - Data paths (workflows, knowledge base)

3. **Integration Points:**
   - Updated `GmailInboxWatcher` to use config automatically
   - Updated `EmailOutAdapter` to use SMTP config
   - Both services now work with zero configuration

### Key Features
1. **Priority System:**
   ```
   Environment Variable > .env file > Fallback dict > Default value
   ```

2. **Helper Methods:**
   - `get_gmail_config()` - Returns Gmail settings as dict
   - `get_smtp_config()` - Returns SMTP settings as dict
   - `get_llm_keys()` - Returns all LLM API keys
   - `is_development()` / `is_production()` - Environment checks

3. **Security Features:**
   - Never logs sensitive values
   - Warns about missing required values in production
   - Sample file provided without real credentials

### Usage Examples
```python
# Basic usage
from services.config import get_config
config = get_config()
print(config.gmail_user)

# With fallback
config = Config(fallback={'smtp_server': 'backup.smtp.com'})

# Integration (automatic)
watcher = GmailInboxWatcher()  # Uses config
adapter = EmailOutAdapter()    # Uses config
```
