**Assignee:** CA
**Branch:** `dev/TASK-161FB-ca-dagrun-state`

### Objective
Build the internal data structure and persistence mechanism for tracking the execution of DAG workflows. This tracker serves as the central record for DAG runs, storing per-step state, retry status, and final result metadata.

### Implementation Details

**Core Components Created:**

1. **DAGRun State Tracker** (`/services/workflow/dag_run_tracker.py`)
   - `DAGStepState` class for individual step tracking
   - `DAGStepStatus` enum: PENDING, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED, RETRY, SKIPPED, CANCELLED
   - `DAGRun` class for complete workflow tracking
   - `DAGRunStatus` enum: CREATED, RUNNING, SUCCESS, FAILED, RETRY, CANCELLED, PARTIAL_SUCCESS
   - Methods for state transitions, retries, and duration tracking

2. **Persistent Storage** (`/services/workflow/dag_run_store.py`)
   - File-based storage with JSON serialization
   - Thread-safe operations using FileLock
   - CRUD operations: create, update, get, delete, list
   - Index file for quick lookups

3. **Unit Tests** (`/tests/unit/test_dag_run_tracker.py`, `/tests/unit/test_dag_run_store.py`)
   - 100% test coverage for all state transitions
   - Concurrent access testing with FileLock
   - Edge case handling for invalid states
   - Performance testing for large DAGs

**Files Created:**
- `/services/workflow/dag_run_tracker.py` - Core state tracking models
- `/services/workflow/dag_run_store.py` - Persistence layer
- `/tests/unit/test_dag_run_tracker.py` - State tracker tests
- `/tests/unit/test_dag_run_store.py` - Storage layer tests

### Key Features
- **Immutable State History**: All state changes are tracked with timestamps
- **Thread-Safe**: FileLock ensures safe concurrent access
- **Resume Support**: DAGs can be resumed from any state
- **Retry Tracking**: Per-step retry counts and backoff metadata
- **Flexible Storage**: JSON format allows easy debugging and migration

### Next Steps
Ready for integration with TASK-161FC (Stateful DAG Executor Refactor) to use this state tracking system in the workflow execution engine.

## TASK-161FC: Refactor DAG Executor to Use Persistent DAGRun State

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed
**Date:** 2025-05-28
**Assignee:** CA (implementation), CC (test fixes)
**Branch:** `dev/TASK-161FC-ca-stateful-dag`

### Objective
Refactor the DAG execution system to use the new `DAGRun` state tracker from TASK-161FB. This enables step-by-step DAG execution with resume support, allowing workflows to recover from partial completion or failures.

### Implementation Details

**Core Components Created:**

1. **Stateful DAG Runner** (`/services/workflow/dag_runner.py`)
   - `StatefulDAGRunner` class that integrates DAGRun state tracking
   - Support for creating new runs or resuming existing ones
   - Step registration with executor functions
   - Automatic state persistence after each operation
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Critical vs non-critical step handling
   - Custom step execution order support

2. **Abstract Interfaces** (`/services/workflow/dag_runner_interface.py`)
   - `IDAGRunner` abstract base class defining the runner contract
   - `IDAGRunnerFactory` for creating runner instances
   - Clean separation of concerns for future implementations

3. **Unit Tests** (`/tests/unit/test_dag_runner_stateful.py`)
   - Comprehensive test coverage for all execution paths
   - Tests for new runs, resume functionality, retry logic
   - Error handling and state transition tests
   - All 14 tests passing after fixes

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `/services/workflow/dag_runner.py` - Main implementation
- `/services/workflow/dag_runner_interface.py` - Abstract interfaces
- `/tests/unit/test_dag_runner_stateful.py` - Unit tests (fixed by CC)

### Key Features
- **Resume from Failure**: Can continue execution from last successful step
- **Selective Retry**: Only retry failed/pending steps
- **State Persistence**: Every state change is persisted
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of step failures
- **Execution Control**: Support for custom step order

### Test Fixes by CC
Fixed 2 failing tests:
1. `test_resume_partial_completion` - Added DAG status reset to RUNNING
2. `test_step_failure_exhausted_retries` - Updated to check result instead of expecting exception

### Integration Points
- Uses `DAGRun` and `DAGStepState` from TASK-161FB
- Leverages `DAGRunStore` for persistence
- Ready for integration with CLI commands
- Can be wrapped by API endpoints

### Next Steps
- Integrate with existing workflow executor
- Add support for parallel step execution
- Implement step dependencies
- Add WebSocket support for real-time status updates

## TASK-161FD: Add Configurable Retry and Error Handling to Stateful DAG Executor

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed
**Date:** 2025-05-28
**Assignee:** CA
**Branch:** `dev/TASK-161FD-ca-retry-logic`

### Objective
Extended the `StatefulDAGRunner` to support configurable retry logic and robust error handling, enabling more resilient execution of DAG workflows in production settings.

### Implementation Details

**Enhanced Features Added:**

1. **Configurable Retry Parameters**
   - `retry_delay`: Base delay between retries (default: 1.0 seconds)
   - `retry_backoff`: Strategy for calculating delays (EXPONENTIAL, LINEAR, CONSTANT)
   - Per-step configuration override capability
   - Backoff calculation method for flexible retry timing

2. **Backoff Strategies**
   - **EXPONENTIAL** (default): delay * (2^(attempt-1)) - doubles each retry
   - **LINEAR**: delay * attempt - increases linearly
   - **CONSTANT**: always uses base delay

3. **Enhanced Error Logging**
   - Detailed error metadata captured in DAGRun
   - Step-level error tracking with stack traces
   - Retry attempt logging with timestamps
   - Aggregated error summary at DAG level

4. **Per-Step Configuration**
   ```python
   runner.register_step(
       step_id="critical_step",
       executor=my_function,
       max_retries=5,
       retry_delay=2.0,
       retry_backoff=RetryBackoffStrategy.EXPONENTIAL,
       critical=True
   )
   ```

**Files Modified:**
- `/services/workflow/dag_runner.py` - Added retry configuration
- `/tests/unit/test_dag_runner_stateful.py` - Added 7 new test cases

### New Test Coverage
1. `test_exponential_backoff_retry` - Validates exponential delay calculation
2. `test_linear_backoff_retry` - Validates linear delay calculation
3. `test_constant_backoff_retry` - Validates constant delay
4. `test_per_step_retry_configuration` - Tests step-specific settings
5. `test_error_metadata_logging` - Verifies error capture
6. `test_non_critical_step_failure_allows_completion` - Non-critical step handling
7. `test_mixed_critical_non_critical_execution` - Complex scenario testing

All 21 tests passing (14 existing + 7 new).

### Usage Example
```python
runner = StatefulDAGRunner(
    dag_run_id="my-dag-123",
    retry_delay=2.0,
    retry_backoff=RetryBackoffStrategy.EXPONENTIAL
)

# Register steps with custom retry settings
runner.register_step("fetch_data", fetch_func, max_retries=5, critical=True)
runner.register_step("optional_enrichment", enrich_func, critical=False)
runner.register_step("save_results", save_func, retry_delay=5.0)

result = await runner.execute()
```

### Key Benefits
- **Production Ready**: Configurable retries prevent transient failures
- **Flexible Strategies**: Different backoff patterns for different scenarios
- **Granular Control**: Per-step configuration for heterogeneous workflows
- **Observability**: Rich error metadata for debugging and monitoring
- **Graceful Degradation**: Non-critical steps don't fail entire workflow
