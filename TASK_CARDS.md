## TASK-161DE: Remediate Docker Setup (Fix for TASK-161CR)

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** 2025-05-27
**Assignee:** CC
**Branch:** `dev/TASK-161DE-cc-docker-remediation`

### Objective
Create a working Docker setup for bluelabel-autopilot with clear support for .env loading and CLI task execution.

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**
1. **Dockerfile** (36 lines)
   - Python 3.11-slim base image
   - System dependencies installation
   - Non-root user security
   - Volume mount points for data and config

2. **start.sh** (64 lines)
   - Executable shell script
   - Dev/prod environment support
   - Automatic .env file handling
   - Docker build and run automation

3. **.dockerignore** (50 lines)
   - Excludes git, Python cache, IDE files
   - Prevents env files from being baked in
   - Optimizes build context

4. **/docs/setup/DOCKER_QUICKSTART.md** (216 lines)
   - Comprehensive quickstart guide
   - Common commands and examples
   - Troubleshooting section
   - Security recommendations

### Key Features
- **Environment Support**: Separate dev/prod modes with different .env files
- **Volume Mounts**: Data persistence for workflows and agent outputs
- **Security**: Runs as non-root user (appuser, UID 1000)
- **Flexibility**: Can override default command via start.sh

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Development mode
./start.sh dev

# Production mode
./start.sh prod

# Run specific command
./start.sh dev python runner/cli_runner.py run digest --input tests/sample_digest_input.json

# Execute workflow
./start.sh dev python runner/workflow_executor.py workflows/sample_ingestion_digest.yaml
```

### Validation Criteria Met
- ✅ Dockerfile exists and follows best practices
- ✅ start.sh script supports both dev and prod environments
- ✅ .env file mounted at runtime (not baked into image)
- ✅ CLI commands accessible through Docker
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation provided

### TASK-161L: CLI Usability Audit and Feedback
Status: COMPLETED ✅
Assigned: WA
Priority: MEDIUM
Created: 2025-05-23
Completed: 2025-05-23

**Description:**
Perform a usability audit of the CLI runner and provide structured feedback about the user experience, error handling, and documentation clarity.

**Deliverables:**
- ✅ Tested CLI commands with sample inputs
- ✅ Identified documentation and usability issues
- ✅ Created detailed feedback report
- ✅ Provided actionable recommendations

**Key Findings:**
1. Missing sample files and incorrect command syntax in documentation

3. Complex JSON input requirements and lack of interactive mode

**Files Created/Modified:**
- /issues/wa_usability_feedback.md
- /postbox/WA/outbox.json

**Notes:**
The CLI is functional but would benefit from improved error handling, better documentation, and more user-friendly input methods. Detailed feedback has been provided in the issues directory.
