## TASK-161AY: Implement Sprint Closeout Checklist + MCP Code Review Protocol

**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** 2025-05-24
**Assignee:** CC
**Branch:** `dev/TASK-161AY-cc-closeout-review-protocols`

### Objective
Implement two key process improvements identified during continuity review: a sprint closeout checklist and an MCP-compliant code review protocol.

### Implementation Details

**Files Created:**

1. **`/docs/system/TEMPLATE_SPRINT_CLOSEOUT.md`**:
   - Comprehensive sprint closeout checklist
   - Pre-closeout verification steps
   - Branch merge procedures
   - Required documentation updates (5 key files)
   - Tag creation instructions
   - Postmortem requirements
   - Repository sync steps
   - Optional test coverage snapshot

2. **`/docs/dev/MCP_CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`**:
   - MCP input/output structure validation
   - CLI and report formatting standards
   - Naming convention checks
   - Performance and memory review points
   - Agent-specific review criteria (WA/CA)
   - General code quality checklist
   - Security considerations
   - Review process workflow

### Key Features

**Sprint Closeout Template:**
- Step-by-step checklist format with checkboxes
- Exact commands for git operations
- Documentation update requirements for all key files
- Verification steps to ensure completeness
- Notes section for customization

**MCP Review Protocol:**
- Comprehensive coverage of MCP compliance
- Agent-specific sections for WA and CA reviews
- Performance and security considerations
- Clear review process workflow
- Emphasis on cross-agent integration points

### Future Automation Suggestions

Based on the manual processes documented, consider these automation opportunities:

1. **GitHub PR Templates**:
   - Create `.github/pull_request_template.md` with MCP checklist
   - Auto-label PRs based on branch naming
   - Require checklist completion before merge

2. **Sprint Automation Scripts**:
   - `scripts/close_sprint.sh` to automate merges and tagging
   - `scripts/verify_docs.py` to check documentation updates
   - `scripts/coverage_snapshot.sh` for test metrics

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Automated MCP compliance checks in CI
   - Pre-merge validation of documentation updates
   - Automatic version bumping for tags

These automations would reduce manual effort while maintaining quality standards. However, the manual checklists provide valuable documentation of the process and serve as a foundation for future automation.

**Files Created:**
- `/docs/system/TEMPLATE_SPRINT_CLOSEOUT.md`
- `/docs/dev/MCP_CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`
