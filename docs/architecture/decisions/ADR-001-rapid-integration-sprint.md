# ADR-001: Rapid Integration Sprint Approach

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: May 28, 2025  
**Decision Maker**: ARCH-Claude (CTO)

## Context

Technical assessment revealed significant architectural fragmentation:
- Two competing workflow engines (WorkflowEngine vs StatefulDAGRunner)
- Disconnected UI components with no backend
- No true DAG execution despite claims
- 6-month market window at risk

Traditional 4-week sprint would be too slow for AI agents capable of machine-speed development.

## Decision

Compress Sprint 4 from 4 weeks to 2-3 days using parallel AI agent execution.

Key changes:
1. **Parallel Development**: CC and CA work simultaneously, not sequentially
2. **Continuous Integration**: Merge working code every few hours
3. **Rapid Iteration**: Ship working increments, polish later
4. **Real-time Coordination**: 15-minute PR review SLA

## Consequences

### Positive
- Dramatically faster time to market
- Proves AI-powered development advantage  
- Maintains momentum and morale
- Enables rapid customer feedback

### Negative  
- Higher coordination overhead for ARCH
- Potential for integration conflicts
- Less time for perfect code
- Documentation may lag implementation

### Mitigation
- ARCH provides real-time orchestration
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Fix-forward mentality
- Documentation sprint after MVP

## Implementation

1. Both agents start immediately on parallel tasks
2. Share work-in-progress early and often
3. Integration checkpoints every 2-3 hours
4. Daily demos of progress
5. 48-hour target for working vertical slice

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Traditional 4-week sprint**: Too slow for AI capabilities
2. **Sequential development**: Wastes parallel capacity
3. **Perfect-first approach**: Delays customer value
