# ðŸš€ Integration Status Update

**Time**: T+15 minutes
**Objective**: Working MVP with real workflows in UI

## CA Progress Report
âœ… FastAPI backend scaffolding complete
âœ… REST endpoints for workflow management created  
âœ… WebSocket route ready for implementation
ðŸš§ Working on real-time event streaming
ðŸš§ Frontend API client updates in progress

**Key Files Created**:
- `/apps/api/api.py` - FastAPI app setup
- `/apps/api/routes/workflows.py` - REST endpoints
- `/apps/api/routes/websocket.py` - WebSocket scaffold

## CC Progress Report
âœ… Agent Registry already implemented in workflow engine!
âœ… DAGRun state tracker complete (services/workflow/dag_run_tracker.py)
âœ… Security fixes merged (credential encryption, validation)
ðŸš§ Working on UnifiedWorkflowAdapter
ðŸš§ Real agent integration in progress

**Key Components Ready**:
- `DAGRunStore` - Thread-safe state persistence
- `AgentRegistry` - Dynamic agent loading (already in workflow_engine.py)
- Security layer - Encrypted credentials, validated workflows

## Integration Points Identified

### 1. API â†’ Backend Connection
CA's workflows.py needs to call CC's workflow engine:
```python
# In CA's workflows.py
from core.workflow_engine import run_workflow

@router.post("/run")
async def run_workflow_endpoint(request):
    result = await run_workflow(request.workflow_path)
    # Store in DAGRunStore
    # Return run_id
```

### 2. WebSocket â†’ State Updates
CC's DAGRunTracker can emit events that CA broadcasts:
```python
# In CC's dag_run_tracker.py
def update_step_status(self, step_id, status):
    # Update state
    # Emit event for WebSocket
    
# In CA's websocket.py
async def broadcast_update(run_id, update):
    # Send to connected clients
```

### 3. Workflow Triggers
Both need to support the same trigger format:
- PDF upload â†’ Store file â†’ Create workflow input
- URL submission â†’ Direct workflow input
- Email webhook â†’ Parse â†’ Route â†’ Execute

## Next Steps (T+45 min target)

### For CA:
1. Connect to CC's `run_workflow` function
2. Use `DAGRunStore` for persistence
3. Implement WebSocket event streaming from DAGRunTracker

### For CC:
1. Complete UnifiedWorkflowAdapter (if still needed - agent registry might be enough!)
2. Ensure agents can process real files (PDF/URL)
3. Add event emission to DAGRunTracker for WebSocket

## Quick Win Opportunity
Since CC already has agent registry in the workflow engine, we might not need the full UnifiedWorkflowAdapter! CA can directly use:
```python
from core.workflow_engine import run_workflow
result = await run_workflow("workflows/sample_ingestion_digest.yaml")
```

Let's sync again at T+45 minutes to test the integration!
