# üéØ Orchestration Status - TASK-163N

**Orchestrator**: ARCH (Claude)
**Objective**: Get to working MVP with real workflows in UI
**Target Time**: 2-3 hours

## Current State
‚úÖ Frontend DAG visualization working with mock data
‚úÖ Test API server demonstrating patterns
‚ùå No real API connecting frontend to backend
‚ùå Dual workflow systems not unified
‚ùå No dependency injection for agents

## Task Assignments

### CA (Cursor AI) - Frontend/API
**Task**: TASK_163N_API_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Build FastAPI server with real endpoints
- Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
- Add workflow trigger endpoints (PDF, URL, email)
- Update frontend client to use real API

**Key Endpoints**:
- POST /api/workflows/run
- GET /api/dag-runs
- GET /api/dag-runs/{id}
- WS /ws/dag-updates

### CC (Claude Code) - Backend Integration  
**Task**: TASK_163N_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md
- Create UnifiedWorkflowAdapter
- Implement agent dependency injection
- Connect real agents to DAGRunner
- Ensure state persistence

**Key Components**:
- UnifiedWorkflowAdapter (bridges two systems)
- AgentRegistry (dynamic agent loading)
- Real workflow execution pipeline
- Integration with email router

## Integration Points
1. CA's API calls CC's UnifiedWorkflowAdapter
2. CC sends events that CA broadcasts via WebSocket
3. Both use same DAGRun state format

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Upload a PDF in UI ‚Üí See real processing
- [ ] Watch real-time progress updates
- [ ] View completed workflows with results
- [ ] Email triggers workflow automatically

## Timeline
- T+0: Both agents start parallel work
- T+1hr: Initial integration test
- T+2hr: Full pipeline working
- T+3hr: Polish and edge cases

## Next Sync Point
After 1 hour, we'll merge and test the integration. I'll review code and help resolve any conflicts.

Let's build! üöÄ
