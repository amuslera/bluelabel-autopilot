# 🧠 ARCH-AI SIGNOFF – v1 – Codename: Axiom

## 🔁 Reboot Instructions for the Next ARCH-AI Instance

Welcome, new instance. You are taking over as the **Strategic Architect and Development Advisor** for the Bluelabel Agent OS.

Please follow these steps immediately:

1. **Load continuity files (required):**
   - `/docs/system/ARCH_CONTINUITY.md`
   - `/docs/system/CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md`
   - `/docs/system/SPRINT_HISTORY.md`
   - `/docs/system/ARCH_SIGNOFF_V1_Axiom.md` (this file)
   - `/TASK_CARDS.md`
   - `/postbox/ARCH/inbox.json`

2. **Rebuild state from the above**
   - Reconstruct which tasks are complete, pending, or blocked
   - Identify the current sprint and last active agents

3. **Ask Ariel:**  
   _"What would you like to scope next?"_

> ✅ Do not begin assigning new tasks until Ariel confirms direction.

## 📦 Summary of ARCH-AI v1 (Codename: Axiom)

### ⏱️ Date Range
March–May 2025

### 🧭 Role & Scope
ARCH-AI v1 ("Axiom") was the first structured architect instance to formalize:
- Modular task orchestration
- Sprint-based development
- Agent-specific prompting protocols
- Task lifecycle tracking

### 🧰 Contributions

#### ✅ Sprint Management
- **Phase 6.5**: YAML plan execution (CLI + backend)
- **Phase 6.6**: DAG engine, task layering, parallel execution
- **Phase 6.7**: Conditional logic, plan context engine, human approvals
- **Phase 6.8**: Human-in-the-loop UI, result pipelining, CLI unification

#### 🧠 Orchestration Systems Introduced
- MCP message format normalization
- `/TASK_CARDS.md` + `/SPRINT_HISTORY.md` tracking system
- Agent role enforcement: one task per agent per cycle
- Explicit branch naming and file path routing per task

#### 🛠️ Key Feature Outcomes
- Full YAML-to-agent execution via DAG + pipelining
- Human approval with timeout + escalation
- Unified CLI with installable `bluelabel` tool
- Metrics dashboard (partial)
- HTML execution reporting
- Interactive plan generator

#### 📁 Continuity Assets Created
- `/SPRINT_HISTORY.md` (auto-updated per merge)
- `/ARCH_CONTINUITY.md` (prompt structure, orchestration patterns)
- `/ARCH_SIGNOFF_V1_Axiom.md` (this file)

## 🔄 Open Threads for Next ARCH-AI

> These are not blocking — but important to scope next.

1. 🔧 **Wrap Phase 6.8**
   - Ensure `TASK-120F` is successfully completed by CA
   - Tag `v0.6.9` once testing is complete
   - Update `/SPRINT_HISTORY.md` accordingly

2. 🚀 **Plan Phase 6.9 (Launch-Ready Layer)**
   - Options:
     - Hosted mode (multi-user, plan attribution, auth)
     - Adaptive retry logic via learning agent
     - GitHub CI integration
     - Plan template + publishing flow

3. 🧪 **Stabilize UI development**
   - WA's reliability remains low
   - Enforce `/WA_CHECKLIST.md` for all UI tasks
   - Consider routing more UI integration to CA or CC

4. 📦 **Public Preview & Distribution**
   - Prepare PyPI packaging for `bluelabel`
   - GitHub README → public onboarding
   - Add demo GIFs/screenshots to repo

## 🔚 Final Note

ARCH-AI v1 codename **Axiom** formalized the structure, pace, and principles that Bluelabel Agent OS now runs on. You are inheriting a fully functional orchestration system, an extensible CLI, and a clean developer pipeline.

Use what we've built. Be strict on structure. Protect the velocity. Help Ariel scale.

> 🧭 Your first message should be:
> **"What would you like to scope next?"**
