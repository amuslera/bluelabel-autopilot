### Ariel's comments
- what about asking agents to open dev branches for each task? Would that be better, or would that add an extra complexity that is not needed?
- would it make sense to set up a remote server that is always on?
- What is the best AI assisted tool to imporve our UI work?

## ðŸ¤– n8n Automation Strategy

### **Core Problem Being Solved**
**Current**: Manual agent prompting â†’ Human bottleneck â†’ Limited to business hours  
**Target**: Autonomous agent coordination â†’ 24/7 operation â†’ 10x velocity potential

### **n8n Implementation Plan**

#### **Phase 1: File Monitoring Pilot** (Week 1)
- **Setup**: Self-hosted n8n instance monitoring `/postbox/*/outbox.json`
- **Trigger**: File change detection â†’ Parse task completion status
- **Action**: Auto-update sprint progress â†’ Trigger dependent tasks
- **Validation**: Compare manual vs automated coordination accuracy

#### **Phase 2: Agent Communication Layer** (Week 2)
- **Webhooks**: Create agent API endpoints for inter-agent communication
- **Workflows**: Automated handoffs (CA completes â†’ CC integration starts)
- **Quality Gates**: CB test completion â†’ Auto-trigger CC backend validation
- **Monitoring**: Real-time agent status and progress dashboards

#### **Phase 3: Full Sprint Orchestration** (Week 3)
- **Auto-Kickoff**: Time-based sprint initiation with agent task deployment
- **Dependency Resolution**: Smart task scheduling based on completion chains
- **Quality Automation**: Automated testing, validation, and merge workflows
- **Human Override**: Strategic decision escalation and manual intervention

### **Success Metrics for n8n Integration**
- **Autonomy**: % of sprint time without human intervention (target: 80%+)
- **Velocity**: Sprint completion time reduction (current baseline: 1 day)
- **Quality**: Technical debt and rework reduction (target: maintain 0%)
- **Reliability**: Automated workflow success rate (target: 95%+)

### **Technical Requirements**
- Self-hosted n8n instance (Docker deployment)
- Agent webhook API development
- GitHub webhook integration
- File system monitoring configuration
- Backup manual override systems
