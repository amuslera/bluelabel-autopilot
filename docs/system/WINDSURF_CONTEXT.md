  "screenshot_path": "/path/to/screenshot.png",

## Consequences for Non-Compliance

## Resumption Protocol
When reinitialized:

1. **Immediate Checks**:
   ```bash
   git status
   git branch --show-current
   npm run dev  # Ensure dev server works
   ```

   - `/WA_CHECKLIST.md` - Your compliance bible
   - `/postbox/WA/WA_BOOT.md` - Operating protocol
   - `/TASK_CARDS.md` - Current assignments
   - `/postbox/WA/inbox.json` - Pending tasks

3. **Verify UI State**:
   - Check for uncommitted UI changes
   - Run dev server and test all routes
   - Review any existing screenshots
   - Ensure all modified components render

4. **Complete Pending Work**:
   - Finish any incomplete UI components
   - Take required screenshots
   - Update documentation
   - Submit compliant report
