# Roles and Responsibilities - Bluelabel Agent OS

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-05-23  
**Phase**: 6.11+  
**Status**: Definitive Reference

## Overview

This document defines the authoritative roles, responsibilities, constraints, and collaboration patterns for all agents and stakeholders in the Bluelabel Agent OS. All agents must comply with their defined boundaries and follow established protocols for inter-agent communication.

## Stakeholder Hierarchy

### 1. Human Tech Lead
**Authority Level**: Ultimate  
**Identity**: May operate under the name "Ariel" in logs or coordination documents

#### Responsibilities
- Oversees phase-level direction and architecture decisions
- Reviews and approves major system changes
- Manages agent compliance and performance
- Sets project priorities and roadmap

#### Powers
- Can override task priorities, agent roles, or planned roadmaps

- May reassign agents or modify their boundaries
- Approves exceptions to standard protocols

---

### 2. ARCH-AI (Strategic Architect)
**Authority Level**: Orchestration

## Inter-Agent Communication Protocols

### Task Assignment Rules
1. **One Active Task Per Agent** - No agent may have multiple active tasks unless explicitly overridden by Human Tech Lead or ARCH-AI
2. **Explicit Assignment Required** - Agents must wait for formal task assignment before beginning work
3. **Branch Discipline** - Every task requires a dedicated branch following naming conventions
4. **No Direct Main Commits** - All work must go through PR process

### Branch Naming Conventions
- Feature branches: `feat/TASK-XXX-description`
- Core branches: `core/feature-TASK-XXX`  
- Bug fixes: `fix/issue-description-TASK-XXX`
- Documentation: `docs/topic-TASK-XXX`
- Audit/Review: `audit/review-topic-TASK-XXX`

### Reporting Standards

#### Task Initiation
When assigned a task, agents must:
1. Create appropriate branch
2. Add task to TodoWrite
3. Update TASK_CARDS.md status

#### Progress Updates
Agents should:
1. Update todo items as work progresses
2. Commit incrementally with clear messages
3. Note blockers in outbox if encountered

#### Task Completion
All agents must end reports with:
```
XX Reports: TASK-XXXX Completed

‚úÖ Summary of actions
üìÅ Files modified
üß™ What was tested  
‚ö†Ô∏è Edge cases or known limitations
üì¶ Confirmed updates to /TASK_CARDS.md and outbox
```

### Communication Channels
- **Inbound**: `/postbox/<AGENT>/inbox.json`
- **Outbound**: `/postbox/<AGENT>/outbox.json`
- **Status**: `/TASK_CARDS.md`
- **Context**: Agent-specific context files

### Message Format
All inter-agent messages must be MCP-compliant JSON with:
- Task ID reference
- Timestamp
- Agent identifier
- Message type
- Content payload
- Status indicators

---

## Collaboration Patterns

### Sequential Handoffs
When work passes between agents:
1. Completing agent updates outbox with deliverables
2. ARCH-AI reviews completion
3. Next agent receives explicit assignment
4. Handoff includes context and dependencies

### Parallel Work
When multiple agents work simultaneously:
1. Tasks must have clear boundaries
2. No file conflicts allowed
3. Integration points pre-defined
4. ARCH-AI coordinates timing

### Review Cycles
1. **Self-Review**: Agent validates own work
2. **Peer Review**: CC reviews technical implementation
3. **Compliance Review**: WA checks against checklists
4. **Final Review**: ARCH-AI or Human Tech Lead approval

---

## Escalation Procedures

### Technical Blockers
1. Agent documents blocker in outbox
2. Attempts workaround if possible
3. ARCH-AI evaluates and may reassign
4. Human Tech Lead intervenes if critical

### Scope Conflicts
1. Agent identifies scope boundary issue
2. Requests clarification via outbox
3. ARCH-AI adjudicates boundaries
4. Updates context files if needed

### Quality Issues
1. Reviewer identifies deficiency
2. Original agent receives remediation task
3. Must address within same sprint
4. Repeated issues affect scorecard
