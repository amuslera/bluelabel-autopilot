## üéØ Project Overview: Bluelabel Agent OS

### **What We're Building**
The **Bluelabel Agent OS** (formerly Bluelabel Autopilot) is a revolutionary multi-agent AI development system that orchestrates multiple specialized AI agents to work autonomously on complex software projects. 

**Core Vision**: Create an AI Operating System where specialized agents collaborate to build, test, and deploy software with minimal human intervention - achieving 10x development velocity while maintaining exceptional quality.

### **Current Achievement Status**
- **Production System**: Complete email-to-PDF analysis pipeline functional
- **AIOS v2 MVP**: Full AI Operating System delivered and tested
- **MVP-Lite**: Minimal viable UI with 4 agents completed in 1 day (600% faster than planned)
- **Multi-Agent Methodology**: Proven at scale with 100% task completion rates

## üìã Task Execution Standards

### **CRITICAL: Working Directory Assignment**
**ALWAYS include in every task assignment:**
```json
"working_directory": "/Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOS-V2"
```

This is where agents do their development work. The autopilot repository is ONLY for orchestration tasks (rare).

### **Task Lifecycle**
```
1. ARCH creates task ‚Üí Deploys to agent outbox
2. Agent updates status: pending ‚Üí in_progress
3. Agent executes autonomously (MAXIMUM autonomy)
4. Agent updates TASK_CARDS.md with progress
5. Agent completes work ‚Üí Updates status: ready_for_review
6. Agent moves task to history with completion summary
```

### **Branch Strategy** (Under Discussion)
- **Current**: Agents work directly on main branch
- **Proposed**: Feature branches per task (e.g., `dev/TASK-170A-dashboard-ui`)
- **Decision Pending**: Evaluate in Phase 6.17

### **Communication Protocol**
```
Agents MUST:
1. Print status updates to console during execution
2. Update outbox.json with current status
3. Update TASK_CARDS.md with task progress
4. Write completion summary to outbox history
5. Include files_created list in completion
```

### **Quality Standards**
- **Zero Technical Debt**: No shortcuts, no hacks
- **Comprehensive Testing**: CB validates everything
- **Complete Documentation**: Self-documenting code + docs
- **Performance First**: Optimize for speed and scale
- **Security Always**: Never expose credentials or sensitive data

## üöÄ Current Strategic Context

### **Where We Are: Post-Phase 6.16**
- **Just Completed**: MVP-Lite sprint with exceptional 600% velocity
- **Delivered**: Complete UI with 4 agents, full user journey
- **Quality**: 100% task completion, zero technical debt
- **Infrastructure**: Clean, documented, ready for scale

### **Where We're Going: Phase 6.17**
- **Primary Goal**: Implement agent autonomy via n8n automation
- **Secondary Goal**: Enhance MVP-Lite with additional capabilities
- **Strategic Focus**: Remove human bottlenecks, enable 24/7 operation
- **Timeline**: 3-5 day sprint (calibrated based on proven velocity)

### **Long-Term Vision**
1. **Full Autonomy**: Agents operate 24/7 without human intervention
2. **Marketplace Scale**: Support 100+ specialized agents
3. **Enterprise Ready**: Production deployments for real clients
4. **10x Velocity**: Deliver in days what takes teams months

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Infrastructure

### **CRITICAL: Two-Repository Architecture**

#### **1. Development Repository** (Where agents do their work)
- **Path**: `/Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOS-V2`
- **Purpose**: The actual AIOS v2 product being built
- **Contents**: Frontend (Next.js), Backend (FastAPI), Tests, Documentation
- **Agent Work**: 95% of all development tasks happen here

#### **2. Orchestration Repository** (Where YOU operate)
- **Path**: `/Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-autopilot`
- **Purpose**: Multi-agent orchestration, task management, monitoring
- **Contents**: Agent outboxes, task cards, monitoring tools, sprint docs
- **Agent Work**: Only orchestration-related tasks (rare)

### **CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR TASK ASSIGNMENT**
When creating tasks for agents, ALWAYS specify:
```
"working_directory": "/Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-AIOS-V2"
```

Unless the task specifically involves orchestration tools, in which case use:
```
"working_directory": "/Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-autopilot"
```
