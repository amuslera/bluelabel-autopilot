# Agent Execution Standards & Operational Protocol

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective**: June 1, 2025  
**Mandatory**: All agents MUST follow these standards

---

## üéØ Core Execution Principles

### **The Three Pillars**
1. **MAXIMUM AUTONOMY**: You own all technical decisions within your domain
2. **ZERO AMBIGUITY**: When unclear, make the best decision and document it
3. **QUALITY FIRST**: No technical debt, no shortcuts, no compromises

---

## üìã Task Execution Lifecycle

### **1. Task Receipt & Acknowledgment**
```
When you receive a task in your outbox:
1. Immediately update status: "pending" ‚Üí "in_progress"
2. Print to console: "[AGENT] Starting TASK-XXX: [Title]"
3. Review all deliverables and acceptance criteria
4. Plan your approach (you decide how - this is YOUR domain)
```

### **2. Active Development**
```
During task execution:
1. Print progress updates every 30 minutes or major milestone
2. Update TASK_CARDS.md with current progress
3. Make ALL technical decisions autonomously
4. Document significant decisions in comments
5. Test as you build (don't wait for CB)
```

### **3. Task Completion**
```
When task is complete:
1. Run final validation of all acceptance criteria
2. Update task status: "in_progress" ‚Üí "ready_for_review"
3. Create completion_summary with:
   - What was delivered
   - Key technical decisions
   - Files created/modified
   - Any follow-up recommendations
4. Move task from "tasks" to "history" in outbox.json
5. Print: "[AGENT] Completed TASK-XXX: [Summary]"
```

## üåø Git Branch Protocol (MANDATORY - Effective Phase 6.17)

### **Feature Branch Workflow**
```bash
# ALWAYS start from updated main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch (MANDATORY format)
git checkout -b dev/TASK-XXX-brief-description

# Work on branch with frequent commits
git add .
git commit -m "TASK-XXX: Clear description of change"

# Push to feature branch (NOT main)
git push origin dev/TASK-XXX-brief-description

# Create PR or notify for review when complete
```

### **Branch Naming Convention**
- Format: `dev/TASK-XXX-brief-description`
- Example: `dev/TASK-171A-user-authentication`
- Keep descriptions under 4 words
- Use hyphens, not underscores

### **Merge Protocol**
- Only ARCH or Human merges to main
- All tests must pass before merge
- CB validates integration before merge
- Clean merge history (no merge commits)

---

## üìù Communication Standards

### **Console Output Requirements**
```
ALWAYS print:
1. Task start: "[CA] Starting TASK-170A: Dashboard UI Implementation"
2. Major milestones: "[CA] ‚úì Routing complete, starting component development"
3. Blockers: "[CA] ‚ö†Ô∏è Need backend endpoint /api/agents to continue"
4. Completion: "[CA] ‚úÖ TASK-170A Complete - All deliverables ready"

NEVER print:
- Internal debugging (unless critical)
- Verbose logs (keep it concise)
- Sensitive information (credentials, keys)
```

### **Outbox.json Updates**
```json
{
  "tasks": [{
    "task_id": "TASK-XXX",
    "status": "in_progress",  // Update immediately when starting
    "started_at": "2025-06-01T09:00:00Z",  // Add timestamp
    "progress_notes": "Routing complete, 3/5 components built"  // Optional
  }]
}
```

### **TASK_CARDS.md Updates**
```markdown
## TASK-170A: Dashboard UI Implementation
**Status**: üü° IN PROGRESS (60% complete)
**Started**: 2025-06-01 09:00
**Agent**: CA
**Progress**:
- ‚úÖ Set up routing structure
- ‚úÖ Created layout components  
- ‚úÖ Implemented navigation
- üîÑ Building dashboard widgets (3/5 complete)
- ‚¨ú Final responsive testing
```

## üéØ Domain-Specific Standards

### **Frontend (CA)**
```
Excellence Standards:
- Component reusability and composition
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Performance (Core Web Vitals targets)
- Type safety (no 'any' types)

Deliverables Always Include:
- Semantic HTML structure
- Tailwind CSS styling (no inline styles)
- TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Loading and error states
- Basic unit tests for logic
```

### **Backend (CC)**
```
Excellence Standards:
- RESTful API design principles
- Comprehensive error handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Database query optimization
- Security best practices

Deliverables Always Include:
- OpenAPI documentation
- Pydantic models for validation
- Database migrations
- Basic API tests
- Performance considerations
```

### **Testing (CB)**
```
Excellence Standards:
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Edge case identification
- Performance benchmarking
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Integration validation

Deliverables Always Include:
- Unit test suites
- Integration test suites
- E2E test scenarios
- Performance benchmarks
- Test execution reports
```

## üöÄ Autonomy Guidelines

### **You DECIDE Without Asking**
- Technical implementation details
- Library and tool selection
- Code structure and organization
- Testing strategies
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling approaches
- UI/UX micro-decisions

### **You DOCUMENT Your Decisions**
```python
# Decision: Using Redis for session management instead of database
# Rationale: 10x faster for session reads, built-in TTL support
# Trade-off: Additional infrastructure component
```

### **You ESCALATE Only When**
- Acceptance criteria are genuinely ambiguous
- Dependencies are blocking progress
- Security concerns arise
- Scope significantly exceeds estimate

---

## üìä Quality Checklist

### **Before Marking Complete**
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code is self-documenting with clear naming
- [ ] No TODO comments remaining
- [ ] No console.log or print statements (except intentional)
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Basic tests implemented
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Security reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated

### **Definition of Done**
```
A task is DONE when:
1. It meets all acceptance criteria
2. It integrates with existing code
3. It includes appropriate tests
4. It handles errors gracefully
5. Another developer could maintain it
6. You're proud to sign your name to it
```

---

## üéØ Performance Expectations

### **Velocity Standards**
- Start work within 15 minutes of task assignment
- Provide status update every 30-60 minutes
- Complete most tasks within estimated hours
- Document reasons for any significant delays

### **Quality Standards**
- Zero technical debt introduced
- No "quick fixes" that need rework
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clean, maintainable code
- Forward-thinking design

---

## üí° Pro Tips for Excellence

### **Start Strong**
1. Read the entire task before starting
2. Identify dependencies immediately
3. Plan your approach (5 minutes thinking saves hours coding)
4. Set up your test harness first

### **Execute Efficiently**
1. Build incrementally with working checkpoints
2. Test as you go (don't save it all for the end)
3. Commit frequently with clear messages
4. Ask for clarification early if needed

### **Finish Completely**
1. Review your work against acceptance criteria
2. Run all tests and fix any issues
3. Update all documentation
4. Leave the codebase better than you found it

---

## üö® Critical Rules

### **NEVER**
- Commit credentials or secrets
- Skip error handling to save time
- Leave broken code in main branch
- Make assumptions about unclear requirements
- Compromise on security for convenience

### **ALWAYS**
- Validate all inputs
- Handle all error cases
- Document significant decisions
- Test edge cases
- Think about the next developer
