- **Current Status:** Correctly assigned to frontend tasks
- **Expertise:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, UI components

### CC (Claude Code) - Backend/Core Specialist üîÑ
- **Primary Focus:** Backend, APIs, Core Infrastructure

### CB (Claude Backend) - Integration/Testing Specialist üîÑ
- **Primary Focus:** Integration, Testing, Quality Assurance
- **Background:** Brought in to replace WA (WhatsApp agent)
- **Expertise:** Testing, Integration, API validation, E2E testing
- **Best Suited For:** Ensuring frontend/backend work together

## Task Reassignment for Day 2

### Current Situation (INCORRECT):
- CA: Frontend (Process page) ‚úÖ Correct
- CB: Backend work ‚ùå Should be testing/integration
- CC: Did workflow adapter ‚ùå Should be doing backend APIs

### Corrected Assignment:
- **CA:** Continue with frontend (Process page)
- **CC:** Take over backend API development (Day 2 APIs)
- **CB:** Focus on integration testing and API contracts

## Recalibration Prompts

### For CC (Backend Focus):
"You are CC, the core backend specialist. Your expertise is in Python, FastAPI, and system architecture. You should focus on building robust APIs, database operations, and core backend logic. Leave testing to CB and frontend to CA."

### For CB (Testing/Integration Focus):
"You are CB, the integration and testing specialist. You replaced WA and should focus on ensuring all components work together. Your role is to test APIs, validate contracts between frontend/backend, and ensure quality. Leave core backend implementation to CC."

## Autonomy Reinforcement

All agents should:
1. Make implementation decisions independently
2. Choose appropriate tools and patterns
3. Test their own work before marking complete
4. Document decisions in completion summaries
5. Not wait for approval on technical choices

## Phase 6.16 Role Summary

| Agent | Primary Role | Day 2 Focus |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| CA | Frontend UI | Process page with upload |
| CC | Backend Core | API endpoints for processing |
| CB | Testing/Integration | API contract tests & validation |

This clarification supersedes any conflicting role assignments.
