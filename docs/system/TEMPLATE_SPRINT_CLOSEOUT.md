# Sprint Closeout Checklist Template

## Overview
This checklist ensures all required steps are completed when closing a sprint. Follow this template to maintain consistency and avoid missing critical tasks.

---

## Pre-Closeout Verification
- [ ] All assigned tasks marked as completed in `/TASK_CARDS.md`
- [ ] All feature branches have been tested
- [ ] No failing tests in main branch
- [ ] All agent outbox reports submitted

## Branch Merge Checklist
- [ ] Switch to main branch: `git checkout main`
- [ ] Pull latest changes (if remote exists): `git pull origin main`
- [ ] Merge each feature branch:
  ```bash
  git merge dev/TASK-XXX-description --no-ff -m "Merge TASK-XXX: Brief description"
  ```
- [ ] Resolve any merge conflicts
- [ ] Run tests after each merge to ensure stability
- [ ] Delete merged branches: `git branch -d dev/TASK-XXX-description`

### 4. TASK_CARDS.md
- [ ] Add sprint closeout task entry
- [ ] Verify all sprint tasks are documented
- [ ] Update task statuses to "Completed"
- [ ] Add time spent for each task

### 5. /postbox/CC/outbox.json
- [ ] Submit sprint closeout report with:
  - Tasks completed count
  - Branches merged list
  - Tag created
  - Documentation updated
  - Key metrics

### 6. Agent Context Files
- [ ] Update CURSOR_CONTEXT.md:
  - Current state and capabilities
  - Recent tasks completed by CA

  - UI/frontend developments
  - WhatsApp integration progress
  - Simulation tools status
- [ ] Review WA_CHECKLIST.md:
  - Ensure checklist reflects current practices
  - Update with any new compliance requirements

## Sprint Summary Generation
- [ ] Run the automated sprint summary generator:
  ```bash
  python scripts/generate_summary.py --sprint <sprint_number>
  ```
- [ ] Verify output is saved to `/reports/SPRINT_<N>_SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] Review generated summary for accuracy
- [ ] Use summary content to inform postmortem

## Tag Creation
- [ ] Ensure all changes are committed

  ```bash
  git tag -a v0.6.11-alphaX -m "Sprint X complete. Brief summary of achievements"
  ```
- [ ] Verify tag was created: `git tag -l`
- [ ] Push tag (if remote exists): `git push origin v0.6.11-alphaX`

## üìù Sprint Postmortem
- [ ] Create postmortem file: `/docs/devphases/PHASE_<X>/sprints/SPRINT_<N>_POSTMORTEM.md`
- [ ] Use standard postmortem template with sections:
  ```markdown
  # Sprint <N> Postmortem - Phase <X>
  **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
  **Sprint Duration:** YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD
