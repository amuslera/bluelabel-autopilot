## Working Patterns
1. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Feature branches: `feat/TASK-XXX-description`
   - Core branches: `core/feature-TASK-XXX`
   - Development branches: `dev/TASK-XXX-description`
   - Audit branches: `audit/topic-TASK-XXX`
   - Always create dedicated branches for tasks

2. **Development Flow**:
   - Use TodoWrite/TodoRead for task planning
   - Read existing code before implementing
   - Write tests alongside implementation
   - Update TASK_CARDS.md upon completion
   - Report to /postbox/CC/outbox.json

3. **Code Standards**:
   - Type hints and dataclasses preferred
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - MCP schema compliance mandatory
   - Single source of truth for models (interfaces/agent_models.py)

4. **Testing Discipline**:
   - Unit tests for all new functionality
   - Integration tests for agent interactions
   - Import structure validation
   - Mock external dependencies
