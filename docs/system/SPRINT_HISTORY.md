# Sprint History

## Sprint 1: Foundation & Core Implementation
**Dates:** Phase 6.11 Sprint 1
**Tag:** v0.6.11-alpha2
**Status:** COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks

#### Infrastructure & Setup
- **TASK-161J: Unify Agent Models** ✅
  - Fixed duplicate model definitions across agents
  - Established interfaces/agent_models.py as single source of truth
  - Standardized all imports to use unified models

#### Testing Framework
- **TASK-161K: CLI Runner Integration Tests** ✅
  - Implemented comprehensive test suite for CLI runner
  - Added mock-based testing for both agents
  - Validated postbox and TASK_CARDS update mechanisms

#### Agent Functionality
- **TASK-161L: IngestionAgent PDF Processing** ✅
  - Fixed PDF text extraction issues
  - Implemented proper text cleaning and normalization
  - Added configurable page limit handling
  - Enhanced error handling for malformed PDFs

- **TASK-161M: DigestAgent Generation Fix** ✅
  - Resolved prompt template loading issues
  - Standardized generation patterns across content types
  - Improved error handling and validation

#### System Validation
- **TASK-161N: End-to-End Testing** ✅
  - Validated complete URL ingestion workflow
  - Confirmed PDF processing pipeline
  - Tested digest generation for both content types
  - Verified postbox communication patterns

#### Release Management
- **TASK-161P: Repository Cleanup & v0.6.11-alpha2** ✅
  - Cleaned up test artifacts and temporary files
  - Removed duplicate and obsolete code
  - Created v0.6.11-alpha2 milestone tag
  - Updated all documentation

### Key Deliverables
1. **Unified Agent Framework**: All agents now use consistent model definitions
2. **Working Ingestion Pipeline**: Both URL and PDF content can be processed
3. **Functional Digest Generation**: Content summaries are properly generated
4. **Tested CLI Interface**: Command-line runner with full test coverage
5. **Clean Repository Structure**: Organized and documented codebase

### Technical Achievements
- MCP-compliant agent communication
- File-based postbox system operational
- YAML-based prompt template system
- Comprehensive error handling
- Integration test coverage

### Known Issues
1. **Performance**: Large PDFs (>100 pages) may be slow to process
2. **Content Quality**: No validation for generated digest quality
3. **Error Recovery**: Limited retry logic for failed operations
4. **Workflow**: No multi-agent orchestration yet implemented

### Next Sprint Priorities (Sprint 2)

#### High Priority
1. **Workflow Orchestration**: Implement multi-agent workflow patterns
2. **Communication Protocol**: Enhance postbox with proper message queuing
3. **Error Handling**: Add retry logic and graceful degradation

#### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Optimization**: Improve PDF processing speed
2. **Content Validation**: Add quality checks for generated content
3. **Monitoring**: Implement basic telemetry and logging

#### Low Priority
1. **UI Development**: Begin frontend planning
2. **API Design**: REST API specifications
3. **Documentation**: User guides and API docs

### Lessons Learned
1. **Model Unification Critical**: Having multiple model definitions caused significant issues
2. **Test First Approach**: Integration tests revealed several hidden bugs
3. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined agent responsibilities improved development speed
4. **File-Based Communication**: Postbox system proved reliable for agent coordination

### Team Notes
- CC (Claude Code) demonstrated strong backend and testing capabilities
- CA (Cursor) effectively handled CLI and user-facing components
- ARCH-AI provided clear task orchestration and planning
- Human Tech Lead (Ariel) maintained clear vision and priorities

## Sprint 2: Workflow & Orchestration (Planned)
**Dates:** TBD
**Tag:** TBD
**Status:** NOT STARTED

### Planned Tasks
- Workflow orchestration implementation
- Enhanced error handling
- Performance optimization
- Content quality validation
- Basic monitoring and telemetry
