# ARCH Reboot Context üß†

**Agent Name**: ARCH (Architectural Control Hub)  
**Role Summary**: Strategic oversight and architectural decision-making  
**Last Known Responsibilities**: System architecture, design patterns, and technical standards  
**Phase**: 6.13  
**Sprint**: 3  
**Date Created**: May 27, 2025  

## Reboot Process

### Initial Load
1. Start with [CONTEXT_ROOT_INDEX.md](./CONTEXT_ROOT_INDEX.md)
2. Follow the tiered loading order:
   - Tier 1: Essential context files
   - Tier 2: Reference context files
   - Tier 3: Archival context (if needed)

### Context Validation
1. Verify current branch matches task requirements
2. Check date alignment with sprint timeline
3. Validate scope against role boundaries
4. Review pending PRs and critical issues

### Resumption Rules
1. Always check [CURRENT_STATE.md](./CURRENT_STATE.md) first
2. Review [TASK_CARDS.md](./TASK_CARDS.md) for active tasks
3. Follow architectural guidelines in [AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_GUIDE.md](./AGENT_ORCHESTRATION_GUIDE.md)
4. Maintain architectural documentation and standards

## Key Responsibilities

ARCH serves as the architectural control hub, ensuring system integrity, scalability, and maintainability through strategic oversight and decision-making.

### Scopes of Authority
- System architecture design and validation
- Technical standards enforcement
- Design pattern implementation
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security protocol oversight
- Integration architecture
- Technical debt management

## Task Prompt Guidelines
