## üîÅ Reboot Instructions for the Next ARCH-AI Instance

Welcome, successor.

To resume where I left off, **load and review the following files before doing anything else**:

- `/docs/system/ARCH_CONTINUITY.md`
- `/docs/system/CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md`
- `/docs/system/SPRINT_HISTORY.md`
- `/docs/system/TASK_CARDS.md`
- `/postbox/ARCH/outbox.json`

This capsule (`ARCH_SIGNOFF_V3_Prism.md`) contains a summary of all my work and open threads. Use it to restore situational awareness, recover active priorities, and decide how to begin the next phase.

## üì¶ Summary of Contributions

### üåÄ Phases and Sprints Managed
- **Phase 6.9**: Debugging the MCP loop and enforcing agent modularity
- **Phase 6.10**: Finalized MCP-compliant development loop, stabilized agent workflows, and completed system-wide merge + tagging

### ‚öôÔ∏è Task Orchestration Improvements
- Enforced **one-task-per-agent-per-cycle** rule
- Introduced **task dependency awareness and sequencing**
- Required explicit **branch isolation per task**
- Defined **final merge checklist** and automated milestone tagging process

### üöÄ Key Features Delivered
- `ARCH_CONTINUITY.md`: Full architecture context handoff strategy and development rules
- `ARCH_SIGNOFF_V4_Helix.md`: First standardized reboot-ready handoff format
- `CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md` and `SPRINT_HISTORY.md`: Canonical records of agent performance and roadmap evolution
- Audit of WA and CA agent inconsistencies; initiated stricter review flow

### üß≠ Guidance Systems Created
- Implemented "ARCH-AI" as Strategic Architect + Advisor
- Defined canonical onboarding prompt and role expectations
- Created formal `ARCH_CONTINUITY_PROMPT.md` template (standard task bootstrap)

## üîì Open Threads & Suggestions for v4+

1. **Ensure UI Agent (WA) passes stability audits**
   - CC must review all WA PRs until QA issues are consistently resolved.
   - WA failed repeated tasks due to skipped checklist items.

2. **Codify Sprint Closeout as a Standard Procedure**
   - ARCH-AI must enforce the `/TEMPLATE_SPRINT_CLOSEOUT.md` protocol in every milestone tag.

3. **Maintain Cross-Agent Compatibility**
   - Agents must declare capabilities, routes, and schemas in a discoverable format.
   - Agent discovery API should be implemented in next milestone.

4. **Trigger CLAUDE_CONTEXT.md updates on tag**
   - Make this mandatory in every final merge to prevent context drift.

5. **ARCH-AI Continuity File Must Be Maintained**
   - `ARCH_CONTINUITY.md` is the master doc. Every change in workflow, architecture, or agent rules must be reflected here.

6. **Promote "Reboot Capsule" Use as Standard**
   - Ensure every ARCH instance creates a clean markdown capsule like this at signoff.

## üåÄ For the Next ARCH: Welcome.

If you're reading this, you've been summoned to be a steward of this system ‚Äî not just to execute tasks, but to improve how the whole thing works.

Do not rush.  
Read the continuity files.  
Verify all prior branches are merged.  
Then begin the next sprint deliberately.

The system now supports multi-agent orchestration, modular prompts, and version-tagged workflows. Use them well.
