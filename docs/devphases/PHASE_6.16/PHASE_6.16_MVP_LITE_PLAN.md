# PHASE 6.16: MVP-LITE SPRINT

**Start Date:** May 31, 2025  
**Duration:** 5 Days  
**End Date:** June 4, 2025  
**Status:** 🚀 ACTIVE

## 🎯 Phase Mission

**"Deliver a working AIOS v2 prototype with core upload → process → view functionality in 5 days"**

Transform the comprehensive AIOS v2 system into a focused, functional MVP that demonstrates the core value proposition: intelligent content processing through specialized AI agents.

## 📊 Phase Context

### Starting Position
- ✅ Complete AIOS v2 architecture built (Phase 6.15)
- ✅ Backend infrastructure operational
- ✅ Agent system functional
- ⚠️ Frontend needs critical user flows
- ⚠️ No agent selection in upload flow
- ⚠️ No agent CRUD functionality

### Strategic Decision
Rather than building the full system, we're taking an MVP-Lite approach:
- Focus on core user journey only
- 4 pre-built agents (no custom creation yet)
- Simple session-based auth (no user accounts)
- All 4 input types supported (file, URL, text, audio)

## 🏃 5-Day Sprint Plan

**CA - Frontend (TASK-170A):**
- Set up routing and navigation
- Build dashboard with recent results
- Create shared UI components
- Connect to backend APIs

**CB - Backend (TASK-170B):**
- Create database schema (3 tables)
- Seed 4 starter agents with prompts
- Build /api/agents and /api/results endpoints
- Set up session management

**Success Criteria:**
- Dashboard displays recent results
- Navigation works between pages
- Backend returns agent list

### Day 2 (June 1) - Multi-Input Upload & Processing

- Implement error states

**CC - Testing (TASK-170H):**
- Test all input types
- Verify agent selection
- Load testing
- Mobile responsiveness

**Success Criteria:**
- Results display properly
- All features tested
- UI is polished

### Day 5 (June 4) - Integration & Launch Prep
**Goal:** Final integration and preparation

**All Agents (TASK-170I):**
- Bug fixes from testing
- Performance optimization
- Final polish
- Documentation

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero critical bugs
- Performance targets met
- Ready for demo

## 📋 Core Features (MVP-Lite Scope)

   - Agent selection from 4 options

2. **Pre-built Agents**
   - Document Analyzer
   - Summarizer
   - Data Extractor
   - Audio Transcriber

3. **Results Management**
   - View processed results
   - Download results
   - Recent results on dashboard

4. **Basic UI**
   - Dashboard
   - Process page

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Upload Success Rate:** >95%
- **Processing Time:** <30 seconds average
- **Error Rate:** <5%
- **Page Load Time:** <2 seconds

### User Experience Metrics
- **Time to First Result:** <5 minutes
- **Clicks to Process:** ≤3
- **Mobile Responsive:** Yes
- **Error Recovery:** Graceful

### Delivery Metrics
- **Features Complete:** 4/4 pages
- **Agents Working:** 4/4
- **Input Types:** 4/4
- **Days on Schedule:** 5/5

## 🚀 Agent Task Distribution

### Day 1 Tasks (May 31)
- **CA:** TASK-170A - Foundation & Dashboard UI (8 hours)
- **CB:** TASK-170B - Backend Foundation & Agent Setup (8 hours)
- **CC:** Available for support

### Coordination Points
- Daily sync at start of day
- API contract agreement (Day 1 PM)
- Integration checkpoint (Day 3)
- Final review (Day 5)

## 📊 Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Integration Delays** → Mitigation: Clear API contracts Day 1
2. **Scope Creep** → Mitigation: Strict MVP feature list
3. **Performance Issues** → Mitigation: Test early and often
4. **Agent Bugs** → Mitigation: Simple, tested prompts

### Contingency Plans
- If behind: Cut agent list page (use dropdown only)
- If ahead: Add basic search to results
- If blocked: Focus on polish over features

## 🏁 Definition of Done

**MVP-Lite is complete when:**
1. User can upload any supported input type
2. User can select from 4 agents
3. Processing completes successfully
4. Results display correctly
5. User can access recent results
6. No critical bugs remain
7. Works on desktop and mobile

## 📝 Phase Notes

- Keep it simple - this is a prototype
- Focus on the core flow working perfectly
- Polish can wait for Phase 2
- Document issues for future sprints
- Celebrate small wins daily
