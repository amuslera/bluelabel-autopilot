# Sprint 4: Rapid Integration Sprint - Revised Timeline

**Sprint Duration**: As fast as possible (targeting 2-3 days instead of 4 weeks!)  
**Sprint Lead**: ARCH-Claude (CTO)  
**Approach**: Parallel execution, continuous integration

## Key Mindset Shift

- **Hours not Days**: What we planned as "weeks" can be done in hours
- **Parallel not Sequential**: CC and CA work simultaneously 
- **Continuous Integration**: Merge working code immediately
- **No Artificial Delays**: If ready, ship it!

## Revised Execution Plan

### Wave 1: Foundation (Target: 4-6 hours)
**Start immediately, work in parallel:**

**CC Tasks**:
- SPRINT4-001: UnifiedWorkflowEngine Adapter (2-3 hours)
- SPRINT4-002: Dependency Injection (1-2 hours)
- Start both NOW - they can be developed in parallel

**CA Tasks**:
- SPRINT4-005: API Specification (1-2 hours) 
- SPRINT4-006: API Client Setup (2-3 hours)
- Start immediately - don't wait for backend

**ARCH**: Real-time code review and integration

### Wave 2: Integration (Target: 3-4 hours after Wave 1)
**As soon as foundations ready:**

**CC Tasks**:
- Implement REST API based on CA's spec
- WebSocket server for real-time updates
- Connect to UnifiedWorkflowEngine

**CA Tasks**:
- Connect UI components to real API
- Implement WebSocket client
- Remove all mock data

### Wave 3: Vertical Slice (Target: 4-6 hours after Wave 2)
**The actual demo:**

**Both Teams**:
- Email â†’ PDF processing â†’ Summary â†’ Response
- Full integration test
- Performance optimization
- Live demo ready

## Communication Protocol - ACCELERATED

### Every Hour:
- Agents post progress
- ARCH reviews and unblocks
- Immediate PR reviews (15-minute SLA)

### Continuous Integration:
- Merge working code immediately
- Don't wait for "perfect"
- Fix forward, don't accumulate PRs

### Parallel Coordination:
```yaml
# Instead of blocking dependencies:
CC: Start API implementation with stubbed endpoints
CA: Build against API spec, use local mocks initially
ARCH: Review both simultaneously, merge when ready
```

## Success Metrics - Simplified

1. **Unified Architecture**: Working in hours, not days
2. **Connected UI**: Real data flowing 
3. **One Working Demo**: Email to summary pipeline
4. **Clean Code**: Tests pass, no tech debt

## New Task Assignment Approach

Instead of due dates, use readiness triggers:
- "Start when ready"
- "Merge when tests pass"
- "Deploy when integrated"

## Aggressive Timeline

**Day 1 (Today/Tonight)**:
- Wave 1 complete
- Wave 2 in progress
- First integration tests running

**Day 2**:
- Wave 2 complete
- Wave 3 implementation
- Full pipeline working

**Day 3**:
- Polish and optimization
- Demo recording
- Documentation complete

## Rally Cry

We're not building for next month - we're shipping TODAY! Every hour counts. 

CC and CA: Start your tasks NOW. Don't wait for permission. Code fast, test well, ship immediately.

Let's show what AI-powered development can really do! ðŸš€
