## Summary
Successfully implemented comprehensive production deployment infrastructure for AIOS v2, including Docker containerization, CI/CD pipelines, environment management, and health monitoring.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Docker Containerization ✅
- **API Dockerfile** (`docker/api.Dockerfile`)
  - Multi-stage build for optimized image size
  - Non-root user execution for security
  - Health check integrated
  - Automatic dependency installation
  
- **Frontend Dockerfile** (`docker/web.Dockerfile`)
  - Multi-stage build with build caching
  - Static file serving with nginx
  - Security headers configured
  - Optimized for production

- **Docker Compose** (`docker/docker-compose.yml`)
  - Service orchestration for local development
  - Volume mounts for development
  - Environment variable management
  - Network isolation

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline ✅
- **Test Workflow** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
  - Automated testing on push/PR
  - Linting and type checking
  - Unit and integration tests
  - Security scanning with Trivy
  - Test coverage reporting

- **Staging Workflow** (`.github/workflows/staging.yml`)
  - Automatic deployment on develop branch
  - Database migration automation
  - Smoke tests after deployment
  - Slack notifications

- **Production Workflow** (`.github/workflows/production.yml`)
  - Manual trigger with version tag
  - Production environment approval required
  - Blue-green deployment support
  - Automatic rollback on failure
  - Deployment tracking

### 3. Environment Configuration ✅
- **Development** (`.env.example`)
  - Template with all required variables
  - Clear documentation for each setting
  - Security placeholders

- **Staging** (`.env.staging`)
  - Staging-specific settings
  - Feature flags configured
  - Performance tuning

- **Production** (`.env.production`)
  - Production-optimized settings
  - Security-hardened configuration
  - Monitoring enabled

### 4. Database Migration Automation ✅
- Integrated Alembic migrations in deployment scripts
- Automatic migration on staging deployment
- Controlled migration for production
- Rollback procedures documented
- Migration status checks

### 5. Health & Monitoring Endpoints ✅
- **Health Endpoints** (`apps/api/routers/health.py`)
  - `/health` - Basic health check
  - `/health/live` - Kubernetes liveness probe
  - `/health/ready` - Readiness probe with dependency checks
  - `/health/detailed` - Comprehensive system metrics

- **Metrics Endpoint** (`apps/api/routers/metrics.py`)
  - `/metrics` - Prometheus-compatible metrics
  - System metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
  - Application metrics (requests, errors)
  - Business metrics (users, marketplace stats)
  - Custom metric tracking

### 6. Deployment Scripts ✅
- **Deploy Script** (`scripts/deployment/deploy.sh`)
  - Multiple deployment strategies
  - Blue-green deployment support
  - Health check verification
  - Automatic rollback on failure

- **Rollback Script** (`scripts/deployment/rollback.sh`)
  - Standard and emergency rollback
  - Version-specific rollback
  - Database backup restoration
  - Notification system

### 7. Documentation ✅
- **Deployment Guide** (`docs/deployment/README.md`)
  - Prerequisites and setup
  - Step-by-step deployment instructions
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Security considerations

- **Operational Runbook** (`docs/deployment/runbook.md`)
  - Daily operations procedures
  - Incident response (SEV1-SEV4)
  - Maintenance tasks
  - Performance tuning
  - Disaster recovery procedures
  - Contact information

## Technical Highlights

### Security Best Practices
- Non-root container execution
- Minimal base images
- Secret management via environment variables
- Network isolation
- Security scanning in CI/CD

### Performance Optimizations
- Multi-stage Docker builds
- Build caching strategies
- Connection pooling configuration
- Prometheus metrics for monitoring
- Resource limits defined

### Operational Excellence
- Comprehensive health checks
- Automated deployment processes
- Blue-green deployment capability
- Automatic rollback mechanisms
- Detailed operational documentation

## Files Created/Modified
- **Created**: 15 files
  - Docker configurations (3)
  - GitHub Actions workflows (3)
  - Environment configs (3)
  - Deployment scripts (2)
  - Health/metrics endpoints (2)
  - Documentation (2)
  
- **Modified**: 2 files
  - `.env.example` - Updated with clearer placeholders
  - `apps/api/main.py` - Added metrics router

## Next Steps
1. Create pull request for review
2. Test deployment pipeline in staging environment
3. Prepare production infrastructure
4. Schedule production deployment window

## Notes
- All GitHub Actions workflows reference secrets that need to be configured in repository settings
- Production deployment requires manual approval as designed
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus/Grafana) setup is documented but not automated
- Database backup procedures are documented but require infrastructure setup
