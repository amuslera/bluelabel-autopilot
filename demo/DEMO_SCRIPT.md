   - Point out the visual feedback with loading spinner
   - Show success notification appearing

2. **Watch real-time updates**:
   - "Notice the workflow appears immediately in the list below"
   - "The status updates from 'RUNNING' with blue pulsing animation"
   - "To 'SUCCESS' with green gradient"

3. **Click on the workflow** to view DAG visualization
   - "Here's our enhanced DAG graph with smooth animations"
   - "Progress bar shows real-time completion"
   - "Live WebSocket indicator confirms real-time updates"

### Part 3: Visual Polish Demonstration (1.5 minutes)

**Script**: "Our UI is designed for maximum visual impact during demos and production use."

**Highlight**:
1. **Enhanced Status Indicators**:
   - Gradient status badges with animations
   - Color-coded progress indicators
   - Real-time timestamp updates

2. **DAG Graph Improvements**:
   - Smooth gradient backgrounds
   - Animated status transitions
   - Enhanced minimap with color coding
   - Professional shadow effects and borders

3. **Demo Controls**:
   - Four different workflow types
   - Visual feedback on button hover
   - Estimated duration indicators

### Part 4: Multiple Workflow Types (1.5 minutes)

**Script**: "Let's demonstrate different workflow complexities."

**Actions**:
1. **Click "PDF Analysis"** (purple button)
   - Show estimated duration (~30 seconds)
   - "This demonstrates document processing capabilities"

2. **Click "URL Processing"** (green button) while PDF is running
   - "Notice we can run multiple workflows simultaneously"
   - "Each has its own progress tracking"

3. **Click "Complex Pipeline"** (orange button)
   - "This shows our most sophisticated workflow with 6+ steps"
   - "Watch the DAG graph handle parallel processing"

### Part 5: Real-time Updates & WebSocket (1 minute)

**Script**: "The real power is in our real-time updates."

**Show**:
1. **WebSocket Connection**:
   - Point to "Live Updates" indicator with pulsing green dot
   - Show DevTools Network tab with WebSocket messages

2. **Auto-refresh Capability**:
   - "List auto-refreshes every 5 seconds"
   - "No page reload needed"

3. **Error Handling** (if available):
   - "System gracefully handles any failures with retry mechanisms"

### Part 6: Architecture Benefits (30 seconds)

**Script**: "What makes this special:"

**Key Points**:
1. **Performance**: "Real-time updates with <10ms WebSocket latency"
2. **Scalability**: "MCP-native architecture for dynamic agent discovery"
3. **User Experience**: "Professional UI with smooth animations and visual feedback"
4. **Developer Experience**: "One-command demo startup with ./demo/start_demo.sh"

## Enhanced Talking Points

### Visual Impact
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: "Notice the professional gradient backgrounds throughout"
- **Smooth Animations**: "All status changes include smooth CSS transitions"
- **Color Psychology**: "Color coding makes status immediately recognizable"

### Technical Achievements
- **Real-time Architecture**: "WebSocket-based real-time updates"
- **Responsive Design**: "Optimized for all screen sizes, including 1920x1080 recording"
- **Modern UI Framework**: "Built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS"

### Demo-Specific Features
- **Auto-refresh**: "Keeps demo flowing smoothly without manual refreshes"
- **Visual Notifications**: "Toast notifications for immediate feedback"
- **Multiple Workflow Types**: "Demonstrates platform flexibility"

## Q&A Preparation

**Q: How does this compare to traditional workflow tools?**
A: "Traditional tools require manual refresh and have static interfaces. Our real-time updates and modern UI provide immediate visual feedback, making debugging and monitoring much more intuitive."

**Q: What about performance at scale?**
A: "The WebSocket architecture scales horizontally. We can support hundreds of concurrent workflows with the same real-time responsiveness."

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: "Absolutely. The demo environment you're seeing runs the same code as production, just with demo data."

## Technical Demo Tips

### For Best Visual Impact:
1. **Browser Settings**:
   - Zoom level: 100%
   - Hide bookmarks bar
   - Use full-screen browser

2. **Animation Timing**:
   - Allow 2-3 seconds between clicks
   - Let animations complete
   - Pause on key visual moments

3. **Screen Recording**:
   - 1920x1080 resolution
   - 30 FPS minimum
   - Capture mouse cursor for clarity

### Troubleshooting

**If WebSocket disconnects**:
- Refresh page (should reconnect automatically)
- Check green "Live Updates" indicator

**If workflows don't appear**:
- Wait 5 seconds for auto-refresh
- Check browser console for errors

**If buttons are unresponsive**:
- Ensure only one workflow triggering at a time
- Check network connectivity

## Post-Demo

1. **Leave browser open** for continued exploration
2. **Stop cleanly** with `./demo/stop_demo.sh`
3. **Share demo URLs** for attendee exploration
4. **Highlight the development velocity** (created in 2-3 hours vs planned 48-72)
