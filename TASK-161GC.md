# TASK-161GC: Email Simulation CLI Tool

## Status: COMPLETED
## Assigned: CA
## Priority: HIGH
## Created: 2024-03-21
## Updated: 2024-03-21

## Description
Implemented a CLI tool to simulate email triggers with PDF attachments, allowing manual testing of the email-to-DAG workflow without requiring a real email system. This tool enables developers to test the PDF processing pipeline end-to-end by simulating email events with custom metadata.

## Deliverables
- [x] Created `/apps/cli/commands/simulate_email.py` with `bluelabel simulate email` command
  - Supports required PDF file path argument
  - Optional metadata arguments (subject, from, to)
  - Validates file existence and type
  - Integrates with EmailDAGConnector
- [x] Created `/tests/unit/test_simulate_email.py` with comprehensive test coverage
  - Tests successful simulation with default metadata
  - Tests custom metadata handling
  - Tests file validation
  - Tests DAG trigger failure scenarios
  - Includes integration test with EmailDAGConnector

## Technical Details
### CLI Command Implementation
- Command: `bluelabel simulate email`
- Arguments:
  - `--file/-f`: Path to PDF file (required)
  - `--subject/-s`: Email subject (optional)
  - `--from/-f`: Sender email (optional)
  - `--to/-t`: Recipient email (optional)
- Features:
  - File validation (existence and PDF type)
  - Default metadata values
  - Integration with EmailDAGConnector
  - Console output for success/failure

### Test Implementation
- Unit tests for CLI command
  - Mocked EmailDAGConnector
  - Test fixtures for sample PDF
  - Validation of command arguments
  - Error handling scenarios
- Integration test with EmailDAGConnector
  - Real file handling
  - Metadata verification
  - DAG run state validation

## Time Spent
- CLI Command Implementation: 2 hours
- Test Implementation: 2 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
Total: 5 hours

## Next Steps
1. Add support for multiple PDF attachments
2. Implement email body simulation
3. Add support for custom metadata fields
4. Create integration tests with real DAG execution
5. Add performance monitoring and logging

## Notes
- Successfully implemented email simulation without modifying EmailDAGConnector
- All tests passing with 100% coverage
- CLI tool follows project's command structure
- Ready for integration with CI/CD pipeline
