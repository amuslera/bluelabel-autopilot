**Duration**: Successfully completed all deliverables

## Task Summary

**Title**: MVP-Lite Day 2: Multi-Input Upload & Process Page  
**Objective**: Build the Process page with multi-input support (File/URL/Text/Audio) and agent selection - the core feature of the MVP.

## Deliverables Completed ✅

### Morning Deliverables (4 hours) ✅
- **✅ `/process` page created** with exact layout specified
  - Page title: 'Process Content'
  - Input type selector tabs: [File] [URL] [Text] [Audio]
  - Dynamic content areas based on selected tab:
    - File: Drag-drop zone 'Drop PDF here or click to browse'
    - URL: Input field with placeholder 'https://example.com/article'
    - Text: Textarea with 'Paste your content here...'
    - Audio: Drag-drop zone 'Drop MP3/WAV or click to browse'

- **✅ AgentSelector component** with all requirements:
  - Title: 'Select Agent'
  - Radio button list with agent cards
  - Each card shows: icon, name, description
  - Mock data for 4 agents implemented:
    - Document Analyzer 📄 (supports: file, url, text)
    - Summarizer 📝 (supports: all types)
    - Data Extractor 🔍 (supports: file, text)
    - Audio Transcriber 🎤 (supports: audio only)

- **✅ Input validation implemented**:
  - File size limits (50MB)
  - URL format validation
  - Text character limit (50,000)
  - File type validation (PDF for files, MP3/WAV/M4A for audio)
  - Appropriate error messages with smooth animations

### Afternoon Deliverables (4 hours) ✅
- **✅ Reusable FileUpload component**:
  - Supports drag-and-drop with react-dropzone
  - Shows file preview and size
  - Progress indicator ready for Day 3 integration
  - Enhanced mobile responsiveness
  - Smooth animations and error states

- **✅ Agent filtering by input type**:
  - Document Analyzer: file, url, text
  - Summarizer: all types
  - Data Extractor: file, text only  
  - Audio Transcriber: audio only
  - Auto-resets selection when switching incompatible tabs

- **✅ Enhanced styling with Tailwind CSS**:
  - Consistent with modern design patterns
  - Tab navigation using Tailwind UI patterns
  - Smooth transitions between input types
  - Fully mobile responsive layout
  - Enhanced mobile tab design with compact labels

- **✅ Enhanced Process button**:
  - Disabled until input and agent selected
  - Stores form data in localStorage for Day 3 integration
  - Shows loading state with spinner animation
  - Form validation prevents invalid submissions

- **✅ API integration with fallback**:
  - Attempts to fetch from `/api/agents` endpoint
  - Gracefully falls back to mock data when API unavailable
  - Caches agent list in state
  - Shows API status indicator (Connected/Offline)
