âœ… Autonomy Setup Complete!

Next Steps:
1. Copy orchestrator/.env.template to orchestrator/.env
2. Add your API keys
3. Run: python orchestrator/autonomous_orchestrator.py

Expected Results (Overnight):
- 50-100 completed tasks
- Full test coverage
- Working demo
- Performance optimizations
- Complete documentation

Investment: 2 hours setup
Return: 8-10 hours of development EVERY NIGHT!
