title: Create UnifiedWorkflowEngine Adapter
description: |
  Create an adapter that bridges the existing WorkflowEngine and the isolated 
  StatefulDAGRunner, allowing us to gradually migrate to the better architecture
  while maintaining backward compatibility.
  
acceptance_criteria:
  - Create IWorkflowEngine interface that both engines can implement
  - UnifiedWorkflowEngine adapter that can delegate to either engine
  - Feature flag system to control which engine is used
  - All existing tests continue to pass
  - Performance overhead <100ms per workflow execution
  - Comprehensive unit tests for adapter
  
technical_notes:
  - Start by analyzing common methods between both engines
  - Use strategy pattern for engine selection
  - Implement logging to track which engine is being used
  - Consider using dependency injection for engine instances
  
  Key files to modify:
  - core/workflow_engine.py
  - services/workflow/dag_runner.py
  - New file: core/unified_workflow_engine.py
  - New file: interfaces/workflow_engine_interface.py
