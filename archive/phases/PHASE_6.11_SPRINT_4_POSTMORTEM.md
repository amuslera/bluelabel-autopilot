## Test Coverage Highlights

### DAG Parser Validation (TASK-161BF)
- **Test Cases**: 5 invalid workflow scenarios
- **Coverage**: Missing steps, bad references, circular dependencies, invalid agents, incomplete steps
- **Result**: 100% graceful failure with clear error messages
- **Key Finding**: Agent name validation deferred to execution time

### Stress Testing Results (TASK-161BG)
| File Size | Pages | Processing Time | Memory Usage |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| 0.14MB | 100 | 0.27s | 4.81MB |
| 0.29MB | 200 | 0.38s | 5.12MB |
| 3.86MB | 2560 | 2.33s | 38.09MB |

### WhatsApp Validation (TASK-161BD)
- Valid URL/PDF inputs: ✅ Correctly processed
- Missing/invalid fields: ✅ Correctly rejected
- Extra fields: ✅ Successfully ignored
- Error messages: ✅ Clear and actionable
