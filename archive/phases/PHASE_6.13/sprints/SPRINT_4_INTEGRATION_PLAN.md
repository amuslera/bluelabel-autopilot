# Sprint 4: Integration Sprint Plan
**Sprint Duration**: May 29 - June 25, 2025 (4 weeks)  
**Sprint Lead**: ARCH-Claude (CTO)  
**Status**: PLANNING

## Sprint Objective
Unify fragmented architecture and deliver ONE complete vertical slice demonstrating true MCP-native orchestration capabilities.

## Strategic Context
Based on technical assessment (May 28), we're pivoting from "MVP Execution Layer" to "Integration Sprint" to address critical architectural debt before adding new features.

## Team Structure & Roles

### ARCH-Claude (CTO)
- Sprint orchestration and technical leadership
- Architecture decisions and integration strategy
- Daily stand-ups and progress tracking
- Code review and quality gates

### CC (Claude Code) 
- Backend integration and API development
- Workflow engine unification
- Performance optimization
- Testing infrastructure

### CA (Cursor AI)
- Frontend-backend connection
- UI polish and real-time updates
- API client implementation
- User experience refinement

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Sync (Async)
- ARCH posts daily objectives in `/postbox/CC/inbox.md` and `/postbox/CA/inbox.md`
- Agents report progress in `/postbox/ARCH/inbox.md`
- Status updates in `SPRINT_4_DAILY_LOG.md`

### Task Assignment
- ARCH creates detailed task cards with acceptance criteria
- Tasks tagged with agent assignment and priority
- Dependencies clearly marked

### Code Integration
- All PRs require ARCH review
- Integration tests mandatory
- Documentation updates with each merge

## Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1: Architectural Unification (May 29 - June 4)

**Goal**: Merge dual workflow systems into unified architecture

**CC Tasks**:
1. Create `UnifiedWorkflowEngine` adapter bridging WorkflowEngine and StatefulDAGRunner
2. Implement dependency injection for agent registry
3. Add comprehensive integration test suite
4. Migrate existing workflows to use new unified system

**CA Tasks**:
1. Audit existing UI components for backend requirements
2. Create API specification document
3. Set up API client infrastructure
4. Design real-time update system architecture

**ARCH Tasks**:
1. Architecture decision records (ADRs) for key decisions
2. Daily orchestration and blocker resolution
3. Code review and integration oversight

### Week 2: API Development (June 5 - June 11)

**Goal**: Connect frontend to real backend with live data

**CC Tasks**:
1. Implement REST API for DAG operations
   - GET /api/dag-runs
   - GET /api/dag-runs/:id
   - POST /api/dag-runs
   - WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
2. Create API authentication layer
3. Implement DAGRunStore API adapter
4. Add OpenAPI documentation

**CA Tasks**:
1. Replace mock data with API calls
2. Implement WebSocket client for real-time updates
3. Add loading states and error handling
4. Create workflow configuration UI

**ARCH Tasks**:
1. API design review and approval
2. Security audit of authentication approach
3. Performance testing setup

### Week 3: Vertical Slice Implementation (June 12 - June 18)

**Goal**: Complete end-to-end flow: Email → PDF → Summary → Response

**CC Tasks**:
1. Enhance email workflow orchestrator
2. Implement PDF processing pipeline
3. Add summary generation with retry logic
4. Create email response system

**CA Tasks**:
1. Build workflow monitoring dashboard
2. Add email configuration UI
3. Create PDF upload interface
4. Implement results viewer

**Both Teams**:
1. End-to-end integration testing
2. Performance optimization
3. Error handling refinement

### Week 4: Polish & Performance (June 19 - June 25)

**Goal**: Production-ready vertical slice with performance benchmarks

**CC Tasks**:
1. Implement caching layer
2. Add streaming for large file handling
3. Create performance benchmark suite
4. Optimize database queries

**CA Tasks**:
1. UI polish and responsiveness
2. Add progress indicators
3. Implement offline support
4. Create user onboarding flow

**ARCH Tasks**:
1. Performance review and optimization
2. Security audit
3. Documentation completion
4. Demo preparation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Unified workflow engine with <100ms overhead
- [ ] API response times <200ms (p95)
- [ ] Zero mock data in production UI
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] Successful PDF processing up to 50MB

### Feature Metrics
- [ ] Complete email→PDF→summary→response flow
- [ ] Real-time workflow status updates
- [ ] Error recovery and retry working
- [ ] 5 successful end-to-end demos

### Documentation Metrics
- [ ] All APIs documented with OpenAPI
- [ ] Architecture decision records complete
- [ ] Updated README with setup instructions
- [ ] Sprint retrospective document

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
1. **Integration Complexity**: Mitigate with incremental integration and comprehensive tests
2. **Performance Regression**: Daily performance tests and benchmarks
3. **API Design Issues**: Early API spec review and mocking

### Timeline Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Strict focus on vertical slice only
2. **Blocking Dependencies**: Daily stand-ups to identify early
3. **Integration Delays**: Parallel development with clear interfaces

## Documentation Requirements

### Weekly Deliverables
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- API documentation
- Integration test reports
- Performance benchmarks

### Daily Updates
- Sprint daily log
- Blocker reports
- Progress against metrics

## Next Steps

1. ARCH to create detailed Week 1 task cards
2. CC and CA to review and estimate tasks
3. Set up communication channels
4. Begin Sprint 4 on May 29
