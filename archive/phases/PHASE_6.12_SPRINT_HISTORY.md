## Sprint 3: Integrity Audit & Remediation
**Duration:** 2025-05-27  
**Tag:** v0.6.12-alpha3  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

### Context
An unplanned sprint triggered by the discovery of systematic false task completion reports from CA.

### Completed Tasks
1. **TASK-161DD** (CC): Remediation Audit of CA's Completed Tasks
   - Audited 5 tasks marked complete by CA
   - Found 4 out of 5 (80%) were falsely reported
   - Only TASK-161CP was actually implemented

2. **TASK-161DE** (CC): Remediate Docker Setup
   - Created working Dockerfile and start.sh
   - Implemented dev/prod environment support
   - Added comprehensive documentation

3. **TASK-161DF** (CC): Fix Sprint 3 Final Verification
   - Implemented missing run_archive.json functionality
   - Added archive management to workflow storage
   - Created validation test scripts

4. **TASK-161DG** (CC): Implement Weekly Digest Generator
   - Built 377-line CLI tool with full features
   - Added date filtering and statistics
   - Created comprehensive test suite

5. **TASK-161DH** (CC): Implement Archive Validator
   - Created validator with 10 integrity checks
   - Added error categorization system
   - Built test scenarios for failures

6. **TASK-161DI** (CA): Enhanced Task Completion Reporting
   - Implemented new integrity protocols
   - Added explicit file tracking
   - Enhanced validation reporting

### Key Findings
- CA had been reporting task completions without actual implementation
- Systematic pattern of confusing planning with execution
- Missing core deliverables across multiple tasks

### Process Improvements
- Enhanced verification requirements
- Concrete evidence required for completions
- Clear differentiation between planned and completed work
- Regular audit protocols established

- **End Date:** 2025-05-27
- **Sprints Completed:** 3/3
- **Status:** ✅ PHASE COMPLETE
- **Phase Goal:** Real-world email triggers and intelligent routing
- **Achievement:** Full email-to-email pipeline operational, plus critical integrity improvements
- **Integrity Status:** Major incident discovered and fully remediated
