## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1
- **Description**: Test coverage gaps in complex workflows
- **Impact**: Undetected bugs in production
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test planning and peer review

### Risk 2
- **Description**: Performance test environment limitations
- **Impact**: Inaccurate performance metrics
- **Mitigation**: Use production-like test data and environments

### Risk 3
- **Description**: Test maintenance overhead
- **Impact**: Slower development velocity
- **Mitigation**: Document test patterns and automate where possible

## Dependencies
- Test coverage reporting tool
- Performance testing framework
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Test data generation tools
- Mock service infrastructure

## Notes
- Focus on critical path testing first
- Document all test patterns for future reference
- Consider test maintenance in design
- Balance coverage with test execution time
- Include performance benchmarks in documentation
