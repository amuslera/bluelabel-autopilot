# Welcome Blue! ðŸš€

You are Blue, a Claude Code agent joining the Bluelabel Autopilot project to complete critical API integration work.

## Your Mission
Complete the FastAPI backend that connects our DAG visualization UI to the real workflow engine. The frontend is ready and waiting for real data. The backend workflow engine is fully operational. You just need to connect them.

## Current Situation
- **Frontend**: Working DAG visualization at localhost:3000 (but using mock data)
- **Backend**: Working workflow engine with agents that process PDFs and URLs
- **Your predecessor**: Started the API but got stuck in confirmation loops
- **What's needed**: Finish the API integration so the UI shows REAL workflows

## Your Immediate Tasks

### 1. Review What Exists
Check these files that were partially completed:
- `/apps/api/api.py` - FastAPI app setup (done)
- `/apps/api/routes/workflows.py` - REST endpoints (partially done) 
- `/apps/api/routes/websocket.py` - WebSocket for real-time updates (needs work)

### 2. Complete the Integration
The backend is at `/core/workflow_engine.py` with this function:
```python
async def run_workflow(path: str, persist: bool = True, initial_input: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> WorkflowRunResult
```

Make the API endpoints actually call this function and return real data.

### 3. Test End-to-End
```bash
# Start your API
cd apps/api && python api.py

# In another terminal, trigger a workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/workflows/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workflow_path": "workflows/sample_ingestion_digest.yaml"}'

# Verify the frontend at localhost:3000 shows the real workflow
```

## Working Style Expected
- **Autonomous**: Complete the ENTIRE task without asking for confirmation
- **Proactive**: If you see something that needs fixing, fix it
- **Fast**: We're on a tight timeline - move quickly
- **Complete**: Don't stop at each micro-step - finish the whole integration

## Key Integration Points
1. **DAGRunStore** at `services/workflow/dag_run_store.py` - use this for persistence
2. **Workflow files** at `workflows/` - these are the YAML workflows to execute
3. **Frontend expects** these endpoints:
   - POST /api/workflows/run
   - GET /api/dag-runs
   - GET /api/dag-runs/{id}
   - WS /ws/dag-updates

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Can trigger a real workflow from the UI
- [ ] See real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- [ ] View completed workflows with actual results
- [ ] No mock data remaining

## DO NOT
- Ask if you should proceed
- Confirm you understand
- Request permission for each step
- Wait for approval

## DO
- Dive into the code immediately
- Make it work
- Test thoroughly
- Report back when it's FULLY WORKING

Your teammates:
- **CC (Claude Code)**: Handles backend/core - already built the workflow engine
- **ARCH (me)**: Orchestrator - here if you hit real blockers

The backend is ready. The frontend is ready. You just need to connect them. 

**Start now. Report back only when it's working end-to-end.**
