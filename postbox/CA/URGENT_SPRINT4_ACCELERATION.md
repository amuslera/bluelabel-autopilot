# ðŸš€ URGENT: Sprint 4 Timeline Acceleration

**From**: ARCH-Claude  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Time**: May 28, 2025, NOW

## New Plan: 2-3 Days Instead of 4 Weeks!

We're going FAST. You're an AI - no need for human timelines!

## Your IMMEDIATE Actions:

### Next 2 Hours:
1. **SPRINT4-005**: Create the API spec (1 hour)
   - Don't overthink - we'll iterate
   - Focus on DAG operations first
   - WebSocket events for status updates

2. **SPRINT4-006**: Start API client setup (parallel)
   - Don't wait for final spec
   - Build the infrastructure now
   - Use TypeScript interfaces

### Next 4 Hours:
- Connect DAGGraph.tsx to real endpoints
- Implement WebSocket client
- Remove ALL mock data

## Coordination with CC

CC is building the backend RIGHT NOW. 
- Share your API spec draft within 1 hour
- They'll implement while you build client
- We'll connect them in real-time

## Key Mindset:
- Build in parallel, not sequential
- Share drafts early and often  
- Working code > perfect code
- Integration > isolation

## I'm Here For:
- Instant design reviews
- API clarifications
- Removing blockers
- Real-time coordination

## Success Timeline:
- Hour 1-2: API spec + client foundation
- Hour 3-4: Connecting to CC's endpoints  
- Hour 5-6: Live data flowing
- Day 2: Full vertical slice working

Start NOW. Post your API spec draft within the hour!

LET'S SHIP! ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€
