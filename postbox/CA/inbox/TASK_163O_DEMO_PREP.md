# TASK-163O: Demo Preparation and Environment Setup

**Assigned to:** CA
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Sprint:** Phase 6.13 Sprint 4 Wave 4
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## Objective
Prepare a compelling demo environment that showcases the full end-to-end pipeline working in real-time. Create demo scenarios, ensure UI polish, and prepare recording setup.

## Branch
```bash
git checkout -b dev/TASK-163O-ca-demo-preparation
```

## Requirements

### 1. Demo Scenarios
Create 3-4 compelling demo scenarios in `/demo/scenarios/`:
- ✅ Scenario 1: URL article processing (tech blog post)
- ✅ Scenario 2: PDF research paper analysis
- ✅ Scenario 3: Email trigger → PDF attachment → Summary
- ✅ Scenario 4: Multi-step workflow with error recovery

### 2. UI Polish
Enhance the DAG visualization for demo impact:
- ✅ Add smooth animations for node status changes
- ✅ Improve color scheme for better visibility
- ✅ Add workflow metadata display (name, duration, status)
- ✅ Ensure responsive design works on recording resolution
- ✅ Add subtle loading states and transitions

### 3. Demo Data Setup
Prepare compelling demo content:
- ✅ Create `/demo/sample_content/` directory
- ✅ Add 2-3 interesting PDFs (AI papers, technical docs)
- ✅ Prepare URL list with diverse content types
- ✅ Create pre-configured workflow YAMLs

### 4. Recording Environment
Set up for smooth demo recording:
- ✅ Create demo startup script (`/demo/start_demo.sh`)
- ✅ Ensure all services start cleanly
- ✅ Add demo reset capability
- ✅ Test on 1920x1080 resolution

### 5. Demo Script
Write a demo flow guide:
- ✅ Create `/demo/DEMO_SCRIPT.md`
- ✅ Include talking points for each scenario
- ✅ Add timing estimates
- ✅ Include troubleshooting notes

## Success Criteria
- All demo scenarios execute flawlessly
- UI looks polished and professional
- Demo can be reset and repeated reliably
- Recording environment is optimized
- Demo script covers all key features

## Deliverables
1. `/demo/scenarios/` - Demo workflow definitions
2. `/demo/sample_content/` - Demo PDFs and content
3. `/demo/start_demo.sh` - Demo startup script
4. `/demo/DEMO_SCRIPT.md` - Demo flow and talking points
5. UI enhancements in `/apps/web/components/`

## Notes
- Focus on visual impact and smooth execution
- Ensure error scenarios also look good
- Test everything multiple times before recording
- Keep demo under 5 minutes total

CA Reports: Start work immediately. This is critical for Sprint 4 completion.
