# Migration Complete - Your Work is Preserved!

CA - The repository migration is complete. Your excellent TASK-171C work has been preserved!

## What Happened

1. We moved AIOS-V2 into the autopilot repository
2. Your MVP-Lite UI code has been properly placed in AIOS-V2
3. The directory structure is now clean and correct

## New Structure
```
/bluelabel-autopilot/
├── bluelabel-AIOS-V2/     ← All product code here
│   ├── pages/             ← Your UI pages are here!
│   ├── components/        ← Components go here
│   └── apps/api/          ← Backend code
├── postbox/               ← Task management
└── tools/                 ← Orchestration tools
```

## Your TASK-171C Status
- Your Custom Agent Builder UI work is complete ✅
- The code is now in the correct location
- You're already marked as ready_for_review

## For Future Tasks
When you get new tasks, you'll work in:
```bash
cd bluelabel-AIOS-V2
```

Simple and clean! No more absolute paths needed.

Thank you for your patience during the migration. Your work was excellent!
