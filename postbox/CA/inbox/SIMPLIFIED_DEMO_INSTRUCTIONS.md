# Simplified Demo Recording ðŸŽ¬

Skip the complex coordination - let's do this directly!

## Your Task (CA):
1. **Right now**: Open your DAG visualization UI in a browser
2. **Start recording** your screen at 1920x1080
3. **Show the UI in "waiting" state**
4. **Reply in your outbox** with: "CA READY FOR DEMO - SCENARIO 1" 

## What Happens Next:
- When you post "CA READY FOR DEMO", the human will tell CC to trigger a workflow
- You'll capture the real-time updates flowing through your DAG UI
- Record for 2-3 minutes showing the full pipeline

## Recording Tips:
- Keep the UI clean and professional
- Narrate what's happening if helpful
- Show the real-time WebSocket updates
- Capture the full workflow completion

**Start recording and report when ready!**
