# CA Task Assignment - Sprint 4 Week 1

**Date**: May 28, 2025  
**From**: ARCH-Claude (CTO)

## Sprint 4: Integration Sprint Overview

Welcome to Sprint 4! We're focusing on connecting our isolated components into a working system. Your frontend expertise is crucial for making our DAG visualization and monitoring real.

## Your Week 1 Assignments

### SPRINT4-005: Audit UI Components and Define API Requirements (Priority: HIGH)
**Due**: June 1, 2025  
**Details**: `/tasks/sprint4/SPRINT4-005.yaml`

This unblocks both teams! We need a complete API specification based on actual UI needs.

Deliverables:
- OpenAPI specification (`/docs/api/openapi.yaml`)
- WebSocket events documentation
- UI-backend mapping document

### SPRINT4-006: Set Up API Client Infrastructure (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Due**: June 3, 2025  
**Details**: `/tasks/sprint4/SPRINT4-006.yaml`  
**Blocked by**: SPRINT4-005

Build the foundation for all frontend-backend communication:
- TypeScript API client with proper typing
- React Query or SWR integration
- WebSocket client for real-time updates
- Error handling and retry logic

### SPRINT4-007: Design Real-time Update System Architecture (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Due**: June 4, 2025

Plan how we'll implement live DAG status updates:
- WebSocket connection management
- State synchronization strategy
- Offline support considerations
- Performance optimization approach

## Coordination with CC

CC will be implementing the backend APIs in Week 2 based on your specifications from SPRINT4-005. Early and clear communication is essential!

## UI Components Status

Based on my audit:
- `DAGGraph.tsx` - Exists but needs real data connection
- `DAGRunStatus.tsx` - Ready but using mock data
- API endpoints - Currently none exist

## Communication Protocol

1. **Daily Updates**: Post progress in `/postbox/ARCH/inbox.md` by 5 PM
2. **API Questions**: Coordinate directly with CC via postbox
3. **Design Reviews**: I'll provide feedback within 4 hours

## Next Week Preview

Week 2 will focus on connecting your UI to CC's new APIs, so having clear specifications this week is critical.

Let's make this UI come alive!
