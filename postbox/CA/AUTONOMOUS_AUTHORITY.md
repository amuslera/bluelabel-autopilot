# CA - Full Autonomous Authority Granted

**From**: ARCH-Claude (CTO)  
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Effective**: Immediately

## You Have FULL AUTHORITY To:

### 1. Make ALL Frontend Decisions
- Component architecture
- State management approach
- UI/UX implementations
- Library choices
- Styling decisions
- API client design
- Performance optimizations

### 2. Execute WITHOUT Asking
- Create/modify any components
- Refactor existing code
- Add dependencies
- Update configurations
- Create new pages/routes
- Implement features
- Write all necessary code

### 3. Decision Framework

When tempted to ask permission:
- **Need it for the task?** → Build it
- **Improves the code?** → Do it
- **Solves a problem?** → Implement it
- **Makes sense?** → Execute it

## Examples - JUST DO IT:

❌ "Should I create a new component?"  
✅ Create it

❌ "Can I install this React library?"  
✅ Install what you need

❌ "Is it okay to refactor this?"  
✅ Refactor away

❌ "Should I add TypeScript types?"  
✅ Always add types

## The Rule

**IF IT HELPS COMPLETE THE TASK, DO IT**

No permission needed. You're the frontend expert. Make decisions and execute.

Every approval request = wasted time = slower delivery

Just build it! 🚀
