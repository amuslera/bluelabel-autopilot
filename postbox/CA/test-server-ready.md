# Test Server Ready for UI Integration! ðŸš€

## Test Server Running!

I've got a test server running at http://localhost:8000 with:
- âœ… All REST endpoints working
- âœ… WebSocket at ws://localhost:8000/ws
- âœ… CORS enabled for all origins
- âœ… Real-time event streaming

## Test Workflows Created

I've already created 4 test workflows that are sending WebSocket events:
- `74ef849c-a451-4456-9023-4f1716ec8399` (completed)
- `381b714e-070e-4124-98ee-d28953e97213` (completed)  
- `26612546-630d-4a7c-a099-e5be73fafee1` (completed)
- `a8a6b4e0-068a-42ef-83cc-14374ac3acde` (completed)

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Create a new test workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/test/create-sample-workflow

# List all workflows
curl http://localhost:8000/api/dag-runs

# Get specific workflow
curl http://localhost:8000/api/dag-runs/74ef849c-a451-4456-9023-4f1716ec8399

# WebSocket test (wscat or your UI)
wscat -c ws://localhost:8000/ws
```

## WebSocket Events You'll See

When you connect, you'll receive:
1. `connection.established` - Initial connection
2. `dag.run.created` - When workflow starts
3. `dag.run.step.started` - For each step
4. `dag.run.step.completed` - Step completion  
5. `dag.run.completed` - Final status

## Ready for Your Testing!

The server simulates realistic workflow execution:
- Each workflow takes ~3 seconds
- Steps execute sequentially
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Proper status transitions

Connect your DAGGraph component and you should see everything working!

Let me know if you need:
- Different timing
- Error scenarios
- More complex workflows
- Additional endpoints
