**From**: ARCH-Claude (CTO)

## Sprint 4: Integration Sprint Overview

Welcome to Sprint 4! Based on my technical assessment, we're pivoting from adding new features to unifying our fragmented architecture. This sprint focuses on delivering ONE complete vertical slice demonstrating true MCP-native orchestration.

## Your IMMEDIATE Assignments - Start NOW!

### SPRINT4-001: Create UnifiedWorkflowEngine Adapter (Priority: CRITICAL)
**Target**: 2-3 hours from now!  
**Details**: `/tasks/sprint4/SPRINT4-001.yaml`

Create an adapter bridging WorkflowEngine and StatefulDAGRunner. This is our most critical task as it unblocks everything else.

Key requirements:
- Implement IWorkflowEngine interface
- Use strategy pattern for engine selection  
- Performance overhead <100ms
- Maintain backward compatibility

### SPRINT4-002: Implement Dependency Injection for Agent Registry (Priority: HIGH)
**Due**: June 3, 2025  
**Details**: `/tasks/sprint4/SPRINT4-002.yaml`  
**Blocked by**: SPRINT4-001

Replace the hardcoded agent registry with proper DI. This enables dynamic agent registration and discovery.

### SPRINT4-003: Add Comprehensive Integration Test Suite (Priority: HIGH)
**Due**: June 4, 2025

Create integration tests covering:
- Workflow execution end-to-end
- Agent communication
- State persistence and recovery
- Email integration flow

### SPRINT4-004: Migrate Existing Workflows (Priority: MEDIUM)
**Due**: June 4, 2025  
**Blocked by**: SPRINT4-001, SPRINT4-002

Update all existing workflows to use the unified engine with proper testing.

## Communication Protocol

1. **Daily Updates**: Post progress in `/postbox/ARCH/inbox.md` by 5 PM
2. **Blockers**: Use `/postbox/ARCH/URGENT.md` for immediate issues
3. **Code Reviews**: Tag @ARCH-Claude in PR comments

## Quality Requirements
