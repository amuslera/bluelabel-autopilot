# TASK-172F: Analytics & Monitoring

**Phase:** 6.17 Sprint 2 - Production MVP Development
**Priority:** LOW (Priority 3)
**Agent:** CC (Testing Specialist)
**Estimated Hours:** 2-3

## Context
With E2E testing complete and showing a 95% pass rate, we need to implement analytics and monitoring to track production usage and catch issues early.

## Working Directory
Work in: `/Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-autopilot/bluelabel-AIOS-V2`

## Branch Setup
```bash
cd /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-autopilot
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b dev/TASK-172F-analytics-monitoring
```

## Deliverables

### 1. User Analytics Integration
- [ ] Implement event tracking system
- [ ] Add Google Analytics or Mixpanel
- [ ] Track key user actions:
  - User registration/login
  - Agent installations
  - Feature usage patterns
  - Session duration
- [ ] Create privacy-compliant tracking
- [ ] Add analytics dashboard views

### 2. Error Tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Set up Sentry for frontend errors
- [ ] Configure backend error capture
- [ ] Add source map uploads
- [ ] Set up error alerts
- [ ] Configure error grouping
- [ ] Test error reporting flow

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Implement APM (Application Performance Monitoring)
- [ ] Track API response times
- [ ] Monitor database query performance
- [ ] Set up performance alerts
- [ ] Create performance dashboards
- [ ] Add custom performance metrics

### 4. Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Create metrics overview page
- [ ] Display key performance indicators:
  - Active users (DAU/MAU)
  - API health status
  - Error rates
  - Performance metrics
  - Agent usage statistics
- [ ] Add real-time updates
- [ ] Export capabilities for reports

## Technical Implementation

### Analytics Events
```typescript
// Example event tracking
analytics.track('agent_installed', {
  agent_id: agent.id,
  category: agent.category,
  user_id: user.id,
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

### Sentry Setup
```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.SENTRY_DSN,
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV,
  integrations: [
    new Sentry.BrowserTracing(),
  ],
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,
});
```

### Monitoring Metrics
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate by endpoint
- Database connection pool usage
- Memory and CPU utilization
- User activity patterns

## Privacy & Compliance
- Implement cookie consent
- Add privacy policy compliance
- Ensure GDPR compliance
- Anonymous user tracking option
- Data retention policies

## Success Criteria
- Analytics tracking >90% of user actions
- Error tracking catches all exceptions
- Performance monitoring covers all critical paths
- Admin dashboard provides actionable insights
- Zero privacy compliance issues

## Testing Requirements
- Verify analytics events fire correctly
- Test error capture and reporting
- Validate performance metrics accuracy
- Ensure dashboard data is real-time
- Test data export functionality

## Completion
When complete:
1. Commit all changes to your feature branch
2. Push to remote: `git push -u origin dev/TASK-172F-analytics-monitoring`
3. Create monitoring guide at `/docs/operations/monitoring-guide.md`
4. Update your outbox.json with status "ready_for_review"
5. Report: "CC Reports: TASK-172F complete - Analytics and monitoring fully implemented, admin dashboard operational, all metrics tracking successfully"
