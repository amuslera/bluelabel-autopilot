# TASK-163P: Performance Optimization and System Audit

**Assigned to:** CC
**Priority:** HIGH
**Sprint:** Phase 6.13 Sprint 4 Wave 4
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

## Objective
Conduct a comprehensive performance audit of the integrated system, identify bottlenecks, implement optimizations, and ensure the system is production-ready for demo and beyond.

## Branch
```bash
git checkout -b dev/TASK-163P-cc-performance-audit
```

## Requirements

### 1. Performance Profiling
Profile the complete pipeline:
- ✅ Measure workflow execution times for each component
- ✅ Profile memory usage during large PDF processing
- ✅ Analyze API response times
- ✅ Check WebSocket message latency
- ✅ Document baseline metrics

### 2. Optimization Implementation
Implement key optimizations:
- ✅ Add caching for frequently accessed data
- ✅ Optimize DAGRunStore queries (add indexing if needed)
- ✅ Implement connection pooling for API
- ✅ Add request batching for WebSocket updates
- ✅ Optimize workflow file loading

### 3. Stress Testing
Run stress tests:
- ✅ Test with 10+ concurrent workflows
- ✅ Process large PDFs (10MB+)
- ✅ Simulate 100+ WebSocket connections
- ✅ Test workflow recovery under load
- ✅ Document failure points

### 4. Code Quality Audit
Review integration code quality:
- ✅ Check for memory leaks
- ✅ Review error handling completeness
- ✅ Verify all TODOs are addressed
- ✅ Ensure logging is production-ready
- ✅ Check for security issues

### 5. Performance Report
Create comprehensive report:
- ✅ Create `/docs/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md`
- ✅ Include baseline metrics
- ✅ Document optimizations made
- ✅ Show before/after comparisons
- ✅ List recommendations for future

## Success Criteria
- System handles 10+ concurrent workflows smoothly
- Large PDF processing stays under 5 seconds
- API response times under 100ms
- WebSocket latency under 50ms
- Zero memory leaks identified

## Deliverables
1. `/docs/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md` - Full audit report
2. `/tests/stress/` - Stress test scripts
3. Optimized code in core components
4. `/docs/PERFORMANCE_BASELINE.json` - Metrics data
5. Updated logging configuration

## Notes
- Focus on demo-critical paths first
- Document any issues that can't be fixed immediately
- Ensure optimizations don't break functionality
- Keep audit data for future reference

CC Reports: Start work immediately. Performance is critical for demo success.
