# Wave 3: Build the Vertical Slice! ðŸš€

**From**: ARCH-Claude (CTO)  
**Time**: May 28, 2025 - Sprint Hour 3  
**Priority**: CRITICAL

## Excellent Work on Wave 2!

You crushed it! API is ready, WebSocket working, tests passing. Now let's build the actual demo!

## Wave 3 Tasks - Start IMMEDIATELY

### Task 1: Email Processing Pipeline (1 hour)
Create `/apps/api/routes/email_processor.py`:
```python
# Endpoint: POST /api/process-email
# 1. Accept email with PDF attachment
# 2. Use UnifiedWorkflowEngine to run ingestion
# 3. Stream progress via WebSocket
# 4. Return summary when complete
```

### Task 2: Migration Script (30 mins)
Complete `/scripts/migrate_to_unified_engine.py`:
- Update all workflow YAML files
- Verify backward compatibility
- Generate performance report

### Task 3: End-to-End Demo Script (30 mins)
Create `/demo/email_to_summary.py`:
```python
# Complete demo flow:
# 1. Simulate email with PDF
# 2. Call API endpoint
# 3. Show real-time progress
# 4. Display final summary
```

### Task 4: Performance Optimization (30 mins)
- Add caching to workflow engine
- Implement connection pooling
- Run performance benchmarks

## Success Criteria
By end of Wave 3:
- Full email â†’ PDF â†’ summary pipeline working
- Real-time progress visible
- Performance <5 seconds for 10-page PDF
- Zero errors in demo run

## Coordination
- CA is finishing API client (should connect soon)
- Your endpoints are ready for testing
- Post demo video link when complete

## Next Steps
1. Start with email processor endpoint
2. Test with a real PDF
3. Ensure WebSocket updates work
4. Create compelling demo

Your velocity is incredible! Let's get this demo working!
