# TASK-172C: End-to-End Testing & Validation

**Phase:** 6.17 Sprint 2 - Production MVP Development
**Priority:** HIGH (Priority 1)
**Agent:** CC (Testing Specialist)
**Estimated Hours:** 4-6

## Context
With frontend integration and deployment pipeline in progress, we need comprehensive E2E testing to ensure our production MVP meets quality standards and is truly ready for users.

## Working Directory
Work in: `/Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-autopilot/bluelabel-AIOS-V2`

## Branch Setup
```bash
cd /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-autopilot
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b dev/TASK-172C-e2e-testing
```

## Deliverables

## Testing Tools
- Playwright or Cypress for E2E tests
- Lighthouse for performance metrics
- OWASP ZAP for security scanning
- BrowserStack for cross-browser testing

## Success Criteria
- All user journeys pass on all browsers
- Performance targets met (API <200ms, page <3s)
- No security vulnerabilities found
- Mobile experience smooth and responsive
- Test coverage report >80%
- Zero critical bugs

## Test Report Format
Create comprehensive test report including:
- Executive summary
- Test coverage metrics
- Performance benchmarks
- Security audit results
- Browser compatibility matrix
- Bug list with severity
- Recommendations for improvement

## Completion
When complete:
1. Commit all test files to your feature branch
2. Push to remote: `git push -u origin dev/TASK-172C-e2e-testing`
3. Create test report at `/docs/test-reports/sprint-2-e2e-report.md`
4. Update your outbox.json with status "ready_for_review"
5. Report: "CC Reports: TASK-172C complete - Comprehensive E2E testing executed with [X]% pass rate, performance targets met, full test report available"
