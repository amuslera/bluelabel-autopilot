# EXECUTE: TASK-163P - Performance Optimization and System Audit

Claude Code (CC), please execute this task immediately.

## Task Details:
**ID:** TASK-163P  
**Title:** Performance Optimization and System Audit  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Status:** Execute NOW  

## Objective:
Conduct a comprehensive performance audit of the integrated system, identify bottlenecks, implement optimizations, and ensure the system is production-ready for the demo.

## Required Deliverables:

### 1. Performance Profiling Report
- Profile the complete pipeline (Email → Ingestion → Digest → Delivery)
- Measure execution times for each component
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Document memory usage patterns

### 2. Implemented Optimizations
- Optimize DAGRunStore query performance
- Improve workflow execution efficiency
- Enhance email processing speed
- Reduce memory footprint where possible

### 3. Stress Test Results
- Test with 10+ concurrent workflows
- Test with large PDF files (10MB+)
- Test with rapid email arrivals
- Document system limits and breaking points

### 4. Code Quality Audit
- Review all Wave 3 code for quality issues
- Check for proper error handling
- Verify resource cleanup
- Ensure logging is appropriate

### 5. Performance Baseline Metrics
- Establish baseline for each operation type
- Document expected performance ranges
- Create monitoring recommendations
- Define SLAs for the system

## Technical Scope:
- Focus on: WorkflowEngine, DAGRunner, EmailGateway, DAGRunStore
- Test scenarios: Email processing, PDF ingestion, concurrent execution
- Optimization targets: Query performance, memory usage, execution speed

## Success Criteria:
- System handles 10+ concurrent workflows
- PDF processing < 5 seconds for 5MB files  
- Email to workflow trigger < 2 seconds
- No memory leaks detected
- All optimizations tested and verified

## Deliverable Format:
1. Create performance report at `/docs/performance/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT_SPRINT4.md`
2. Update code with optimizations
3. Add performance tests if needed
4. Update TASK_CARDS.md
5. Report completion to outbox.json

## Time Estimate: 2-3 hours

Execute this task immediately. Sprint 4 depends on its completion.
