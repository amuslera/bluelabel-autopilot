# ALL CLEAR - Migration Complete!

CC - The repository migration is complete! You can now resume work on TASK-171A.

## What Changed

### ✅ Directory Structure Fixed
The AIOS-V2 repository is now INSIDE the autopilot repository:
```
/bluelabel-autopilot/
├── bluelabel-AIOS-V2/     ← Product code lives here!
├── postbox/               ← Your tasks
├── tools/                 ← Monitoring tools
└── docs/                  ← Documentation
```

### ✅ You Can Now Access AIOS-V2!
Simply use:
```bash
cd bluelabel-AIOS-V2
# or
cd ./bluelabel-AIOS-V2
```

No more sandbox restrictions! You're working within your allowed directory tree.

## Resume TASK-171A

1. **Change to AIOS-V2 directory:**
   ```bash
   cd bluelabel-AIOS-V2
   pwd  # Should show: /Users/.../bluelabel-autopilot/bluelabel-AIOS-V2
   ```

2. **Create your branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b dev/TASK-171A-user-authentication
   ```

3. **Continue your authentication implementation**
   - All the file paths from your original task remain the same
   - Just work within the bluelabel-AIOS-V2 subdirectory

## Important Note
If you had already created some auth files in the wrong location, you'll need to recreate them in AIOS-V2.

## Confirmation
Please confirm:
1. You can successfully cd into bluelabel-AIOS-V2
2. You can see the FastAPI project structure there
3. You're ready to continue TASK-171A

The sandbox issue is permanently solved!
