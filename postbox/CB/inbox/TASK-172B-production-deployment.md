# TASK-172B: Production Deployment Pipeline

**Phase:** 6.17 Sprint 2 - Production MVP Development
**Priority:** HIGH (Priority 1)
**Agent:** CB (Backend Specialist)
**Estimated Hours:** 4-6

## Context
With our production features complete from Sprint 1, we need to create a robust deployment pipeline that enables continuous delivery to production with confidence.

## Working Directory
Work in: `/Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-autopilot/bluelabel-AIOS-V2`

## Branch Setup
```bash
cd /Users/arielmuslera/Development/Projects/bluelabel-autopilot
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b dev/TASK-172B-production-deployment
```

## Deliverables

### 1. Docker Containerization
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for API service
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for frontend app
- [ ] Set up docker-compose for local development
- [ ] Configure multi-stage builds for optimization
- [ ] Add health check configurations
- [ ] Document container orchestration

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Create workflow for automated testing
- [ ] Add build and push to container registry
- [ ] Implement staging deployment
- [ ] Add production deployment with approval
- [ ] Configure secret management
- [ ] Add rollback mechanisms

### 3. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set up environment-specific configs (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Create .env.example templates
- [ ] Implement config validation
- [ ] Add feature flags support
- [ ] Document all environment variables

### 4. Database Migrations
- [ ] Automate Alembic migrations in deployment
- [ ] Add migration rollback procedures
- [ ] Create seed data scripts
- [ ] Implement backup before migration
- [ ] Add migration status checks

### 5. Health & Monitoring
- [ ] Create /health endpoint
- [ ] Add /metrics endpoint
- [ ] Implement readiness checks
- [ ] Add liveness probes
- [ ] Configure logging aggregation

## Technical Requirements
- Use Docker best practices (minimal layers, security scanning)
- Implement zero-downtime deployments
- Ensure secrets are never exposed
- Follow 12-factor app principles
- Add comprehensive deployment documentation

## Success Criteria
- Automated deployments working
- All services containerized
- Health checks passing
- Migrations automated
- Zero-downtime deployments verified
- Rollback tested and documented

## Security Considerations
- No secrets in code or images
- Implement container scanning
- Use least-privilege principles
- Enable audit logging
- Document security procedures

## Completion
When complete:
1. Commit all changes to your feature branch
2. Push to remote: `git push -u origin dev/TASK-172B-production-deployment`
3. Update your outbox.json with status "ready_for_review"
4. Report: "CB Reports: TASK-172B complete - Production deployment pipeline fully operational with CI/CD, containerization, and automated migrations"

Use your backend expertise to create a bulletproof deployment system!
